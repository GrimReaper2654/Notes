**Henry le Bird Lore**<br>
Toweringly grand palm trees swayed effortlessly in the gentle zephyrs, casting intricate dappled shadows on the powdery white sands that glistened below. The crystalline waters that intimately caressed the shore exhibited an invigorating hue of turquoise, brimming with a cornucopia of tropical fish that flitted with wild abandon amongst the resplendent coral reefs that enveloped the island. The Choyuni tribe's modest huts were strategically dotted amidst the flourishing jungle, their rustic thatched roofs exquisitely blending in with the verdant foliage of the surrounding landscape. The luxuriant vegetation was a magnificent symphony of a multitude of colours, adorned with an extravagant array of exotic flowers that bloomed profusely in every hue imaginable. The lush jungle canopy, with its impenetrable thickness, provided an enduring refuge from the scorching sun's blazing rays, while the entwined vines and gnarled roots of the ancient trees furnished a natural sanctuary for the thriving and diverse wildlife that called the island home. <br><br>

Standing atop a rugged precipice of the mountain, Henry le Bird smiled with contentment as he surveyed the magnificence of his village. It was a creation of divine craftsmanship, meticulously fashioned by the Choyuni gods, who were even more omnipotent than even himself. The structural integrity of each edifice was a testament to the gods' skill, with every single log and plank laid down with unerring purpose and precision. The cobblestone path was adorned with pebbles that had been laboriously shaped over the span of centuries, and even the livestock was endowed with a divine gift of immunity against maladies and ailments. Waving his snail-shaped staff with grandeur and grace, Henry chanted a reverential hymn of praise and adoration to the almighty gods, and in return, was bestowed with a bountiful benediction. <br><br>

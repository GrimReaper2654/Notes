**The Gaming Laptop:**<br>
Today, as I entered the dreadful chamber known as Ms Pilling’s chemistry classroom, a foreboding sight unfurled before my eyes, a recurring nightmare etched into the canvas of my mind. Andy Ni had brought his new gaming laptop into the sanctum, an imposing colossus of silicon and steel. The Forklift he used to bring it in was still running idle at the back. <br><br>

Sweat poured down my face, my gaze transfixed upon the Leviathan, a 700-pound embodiment of digital excess. Andy's desk, fortified with robust steel beams, creaked under the weight of his new laptop. Cables, thicker than Andy’s thighs snaked through the classroom, seeking sustenance from the puny 240V mains. <br><br>

I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a f*cking outlet. Tears stream down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. “No,” I whisper to myself, “this can’t be happening!” <br><br>

Ms Pilling starts the lecture. Andy, the harbinger of doom, activates his hellish machine. In an instant, the keyboard's RGB backlit keys flare to life like a nuclear flash, frying my retinas. An abyssal hum emerged, a cacophonous crescendo that shook my very soul. The city's power grid faltered, the 7 light water nuclear reactors failing to keep up with the voracious appetite of the behemoth. <br><br>

Within the depth of the mechanical leviathan, colossal fans whirred to life. My vision darkened, the monstrous machine dragging everything I held dear into the abyss. A tempest's wail at 150 miles per hour tore at my flailing limbs and the 500 decibels groan of the cooling fans bursts every blood vessel in my ears. <br><br>

My body succumbed, yielding to the irresistible tide of devastation. Blood poured from my ears as the classroom collapsed, the reinforced concrete superstructure designed to dangle a magnitude 9 earthquake futilely resisting the tremors emanating from the leviathan. As my soul wept, the school, and the very city itself, cascaded into the chasm of oblivion. As my consciousness faded into the eternal howling of the fans, I thought bitterly to myself: ‘I f*cking hate gaming laptops!’

**Edward Lore** <br>
With a languid motion, Edward pried open his eyes, his chest throbbing with a dull, persistent ache. His surroundings materialized before him—an assemblage of pristine white walls, ethereal curtains, and immaculate sheets. It was a hospital room, but not the dilapidated one steeped in nostalgic memories from his childhood. This sterile abode exuded a novel, glossy veneer, emanating an air of modernity. The room reverberated with the dissonant symphony of machines, their metallic beeps, and gentle hums, seeping into his consciousness. <br><br>

"Edward! You're awake!" exclaimed a voice, brimming with exuberance. He turned his head, and there stood Shan-Mei, his object of affection. Her cascading ebony hair framed her slender physique, adorned with a pristine school uniform. <br><br>

"Hey, Shan-Mei," he croaked, his voice barely above a whisper. "What happened?" <br><br>

"Do you not remember?" she inquired, clasping his hand with fervour. "You got beaten up by Taj, the terrorist demon. That thing nearly cut you in half!" <br><br>

Edward blinked, grappling with fragmented fragments of memory. Vaguely, he pieced together an image of a shadowy figure concealed beneath a black mask, wielding a serrated obsidian blade with a maniacal grin plastered on his face. <br><br>

"Where is he? Was he defeated?" he implored, his voice quivering with anticipation. <br><br>

Shan-Mei shook her head, a touch of sorrow tainting her expression. "He is probably dead. Purple Maize killed him with an energy blast, although his body was never found. Taj could still be out there somewhere." <br><br>

Edward was beset by a clammy perspiration, tracing an icy path across his furrowed brow. He directed his gaze towards the window, where the resplendent sun cast its golden radiance upon a boundless expanse of sand, a vista that typified his residence in a diminutive desert town. This forsaken outpost harboured a select, dependable cadre of survivors, united by their shared confrontation with the unfathomable horrors that plagued the Earth. Taj stood as but one amongst the few macabre entities enshrined within the surviving manuscripts of the Choyuni bible. <br><br>

A groan of agonized despair shattered the fragile calm, commanding Edward's attention. His gaze swerved towards the adjacent hospital bed, where the enigmatic figure known as Reaper lay, ensconced in an intricate web of bandages that concealed his entire form. This military aficionado, renowned for his indomitable spirit, had likewise succumbed to the merciless assault of Taj, sacrificing himself in the futile endeavour of safeguarding Edward from the clutches of the nefarious demon. <br><br>

Tears welled in Edward's eyes as he recalled the chemistry that he had missed out on. Reaper’s health mattered little to him. An indescribable sense of guilt gnawed at Edward’s core, for he hadn’t been studying chem in the weeks that he had been unconscious. <br><br>

Summoning the reservoirs of fortitude nestled deep within his being, Edward gingerly extended a quivering hand towards the sterile surface of the IV drip frame, resolute in his aspiration to stand up. "I must study chem," he lamented, an unsteady cadence marking his proclamation, "Chem is too important!" <br><br>

And then, almost imperceptibly, the metallic bonding withing the base of the frame weakened. Metal groaned as Edward collapsed onto the ground in a sprawling heap, his legs unable to support the weight of his body. <br><br>

"Edward," Shan-Mei gasped, "Don’t push yourself, I’ll bring you your chem homework." 
Edward's chest swelled with a renewed sense of purpose, intertwining with the flickering embers of hope that danced within his soul. In that fleeting moment, as their gazes met, an unbreakable pledge formed between them. “I love you, Shan-Mei. You’re the best.” Edward rasped as he lay back down in the hospital bed, “The chem homework is on the second shelf in my bedroom.” <br><br>

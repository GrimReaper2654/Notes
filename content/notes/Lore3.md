**Edward Lore** <br>
With a languid motion, Edward pried open his eyes, his chest throbbing with a dull, persistent ache. His surroundings materialized before him—an assemblage of pristine white walls, ethereal curtains, and immaculate sheets. It was a hospital room, but not the dilapidated one steeped in nostalgic memories from his childhood. This sterile abode exuded a novel, glossy veneer, emanating an air of modernity. The room reverberated with the dissonant symphony of machines, their metallic beeps, and gentle hums, seeping into his consciousness. <br><br>

"Edward! You're awake!" exclaimed a voice, brimming with exuberance. He turned his head, and there stood Shan-Mei, his object of affection. Her cascading ebony hair framed her slender physique, adorned with a pristine school uniform. <br><br>

"Hey, Shan-Mei," he croaked, his voice barely above a whisper. "What happened?" <br><br>

"Do you not remember?" she inquired, clasping his hand with fervour. "You got beaten up by Taj, the terrorist demon. That thing nearly cut you in half!" <br><br>

Edward blinked, grappling with fragmented fragments of memory. Vaguely, he pieced together an image of a shadowy figure concealed beneath a black mask, wielding a serrated obsidian blade with a maniacal grin plastered on his face. <br><br>

"Where is he? Was he defeated?" he implored, his voice quivering with anticipation. <br><br>

Shan-Mei shook her head, a touch of sorrow tainting her expression. "He is probably dead. Purple Maize killed him with an energy blast, although his body was never found. Taj could still be out there somewhere." <br><br>

Edward was beset by a clammy perspiration, tracing an icy path across his furrowed brow. He directed his gaze towards the window, where the resplendent sun cast its golden radiance upon a boundless expanse of sand, a vista that typified his residence in a diminutive desert town. This forsaken outpost harboured a select, dependable cadre of survivors, united by their shared confrontation with the unfathomable horrors that plagued the Earth. Taj stood as but one amongst the few macabre entities enshrined within the surviving manuscripts of the Choyuni bible. <br><br>

A groan of agonized despair shattered the fragile calm, commanding Edward's attention. His gaze swerved towards the adjacent hospital bed, where the enigmatic figure known as Reaper lay, ensconced in an intricate web of bandages that concealed his entire form. This military aficionado, renowned for his indomitable spirit, had likewise succumbed to the merciless assault of Taj, sacrificing himself in the futile endeavour of safeguarding Edward from the clutches of the nefarious demon. <br><br>

Tears welled in Edward's eyes as he recalled the chemistry that he had missed out on. Reaper’s health mattered little to him. An indescribable sense of guilt gnawed at Edward’s core, for he hadn’t been studying chem in the weeks that he had been unconscious. <br><br>

Summoning the reservoirs of fortitude nestled deep within his being, Edward gingerly extended a quivering hand towards the sterile surface of the IV drip frame, resolute in his aspiration to stand up. "I must study chem," he lamented, an unsteady cadence marking his proclamation, "Chem is too important!" <br><br>

And then, almost imperceptibly, the metallic bonding withing the base of the frame weakened. Metal groaned as Edward collapsed onto the ground in a sprawling heap, his legs unable to support the weight of his body. <br><br>

"Edward," Shan-Mei gasped, "Don’t push yourself, I’ll bring you your chem homework." 
Edward's chest swelled with a renewed sense of purpose, intertwining with the flickering embers of hope that danced within his soul. In that fleeting moment, as their gazes met, an unbreakable bond formed between them. “I love you, Shan-Mei. You’re the best.” Edward rasped as he lay back down in the hospital bed, “The chem homework is on the second shelf in my bedroom.” <br><br>

As Edward stared at Shan-Mei’s departing visage, his burning desire to complete his chemistry clouded his mind. “Hmm, 9.8% hydrogen, 65.6% oxygen, 18.3% carbon… That girl will make an excellent specimen for lab testing, I should work to build positive relations with her.” As Edward impatiently awaited the arrival of his chemistry equipment, he pondered another question that had been on his mind. “Why did I even try to save her in the first place?” Edward thought, scratching his chin, “Oh, I remember now. That idiot Taj was making a ruckus outside, stopping me from getting precise measurements. I had to beat him up for messing with my experiments.” Eyes burning with righteous fury, Edward envisioned the death of the terrorist demon by his own hands as an evil grin threatened to split his face in half. <br><br>

Hours later, Edward’s sinister laughter pervaded his makeshift laboratory, where he skilfully manipulated the molecular essence of his elixirs, infusing them with insidious purpose. His beady black eyes glimmered with a diabolical luminescence as he skilfully amalgamated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and benzene rings. Engaging in an intricate and macabre choreography of alchemy, Edward pulverized azure crystals into a refined powder while applying heat to a bubbling solution atop a Bunsen flame. Executing a singular, well-practiced motion, he harmoniously blended several vials of chemicals, resulting in the formation of a white powder that Edward assiduously amassed within a diminutive flask. As he deeply inhaled the aroma of his triumph, a contented smile played upon Edward's countenance, as he concealed the minuscule vessel of maleficent toxins within his pocket. <br><br>

Consumed by his malevolent pursuits and equipped with a formidable arsenal of lethal compounds, Edward proceeded to retrieve a copy of the town's newspaper, his intention being to avoid overlooking any consequential events that may have unfolded during his unconsciousness. Swiftly, his gaze was besieged by a barrage of bold crimson headlines, relentlessly assaulting his visual faculties. "Town's Memory Depleted Once More," they proclaimed with audacity. A sigh escaped Edward's lips as he turned the page, desperately seeking news of greater relevance. Upon encountering the report of a ravaging sandstorm that had laid waste to Kento's poultry ranch, an insidious grin crept across Edward's countenance, a sinister satisfaction arising within him. His thoughts betrayed a contemptuous amusement: "Heh, he had it coming, that fool." Yet, his twisted intrigue deepened as he perused further, discovering a disconcerting entry detailing the sighting of the mythical creature dubbed Wace, its proximity to the town eliciting a shudder of foreboding. And then, a revelation that ignited a seething fury within him: "Shan-Mei Ascends to the position of Mayor!" In an outburst of incensed wrath, the crumpled newspaper was callously flung onto the laboratory table, its contours mirroring Edward's inner turmoil. Clenching his fists with fervent rage, he bellowed with malicious intent, "How dare Shan-Mei usurp my rightful place as mayor! That position is rightfully mine to claim! I saved that girl from that terrorist, and this is how she repays me?" <br><br>

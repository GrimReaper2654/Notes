**I Am English: I am Poem**<br>
I am the deadlines that I dread, <br>
I am the pressure that fills my head, <br>
I am the pages that I must read, <br>
I am the annotations that I must embed. <br>

I am the essays that I can't complete, <br>
I am the grades that can't compete, <br>
I am the drafts I always delete, <br>
I am the persuasive essays that become obsolete. <br>

I am the stress that consumes my days, <br>
I am the doubts that cloud my ways, <br>
I am the exhaustion that never fades, <br>
I am the burnout that silently invades. <br>

I am the pressure to achieve success, <br>
I am the fear of failure that I suppress, <br>
I am the frustration when I regress, <br>
I am the disappointment when I obsess. <br>

I am the search for meaning and hope, <br>
I am the struggle to simply cope, <br>
I am the emptiness that fills my mind, <br>
I am the purpose I cannot find, <br>

I am the Year 11 ATAR English student, <br>
I am the person who's always indolent, <br>
I am the pain that always burns, <br>
I am the pointlessness that still returns. <br>

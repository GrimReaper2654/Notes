**Taj Lore:** <br>
A cataclysmic explosion tore apart the boundless desert, unleashing an enormous storm of fiery rage into the skies. The tranquil heavens, once adorned with celestial hues, were engulfed by an unforgiving inferno, radiating a brilliant and scorching light. An ominous shockwave, a relentless behemoth, surged forth like a monstrous tidal wave of annihilation, obliterating everything in its path. The earth convulsed in violent spasms, trembling in terror beneath the insatiable power of the detonation. Majestic peaks on the opposite side of the world crumbled like ancient titans conceding to their ultimate defeat, their lofty summits dissolving into the tumultuous winds. Seas writhed in agonizing turmoil, their once serene countenance transformed into seething cauldrons of fury, colossal tidal waves advancing with voracity, greedily consuming the remnants of past civilizations. <br><br>

A solitary entity tumbled through the stratosphere, its appendages enshrouded in the remnants of fiery devastation. Adorning its form were colossal lacerations that traversed its torso, exuding a torrential cascade of blood. In the aftermath of his ignominious defeat suffered at the merciless hands of Purple Maize, an overwhelming torrent of shame and impotence assailed Taj, encapsulating his being as he persisted in his suborbital descent. Unfathomable torment surged unabated, ravaging his very nerves as the vestiges of holy energy from the deity's assault continued to ravage the terrorist’s enfeebled corporeal existence, the emanation of his own demonic power dissipating into the ethereal realm. A veritable deluge of scarlet liquid spewed forth from his oral cavity and auricles, manifesting a sanguine river that marred the sky's expanse. A spine-chilling, vociferous bellow of anguish erupted from Taj's maw as the terrain loomed menacingly beneath him, its jagged protrusions and thorny shrubbery poised to exacerbate his already grievous wounds. In the grip of imminent unconsciousness, Taj's consciousness succumbed, while an immense column of dust and soil erupted forth into the atmosphere, heralding his undignified homecoming to the terrestrial plane. <br><br>

"Too weak... Too slow... Too foolish... I was never strong enough," Taj lamented, the softly spoken yet resolute phrases resonating within the depths of his consciousness. "I never stood a chance." The impenetrable, lightless void enveloping Taj's mind shifted, with the murky haze receding to unveil a familiar tableau, a remnant of a bygone era. The luxuriant foliage of Choyuni island sprawled around him, while the cerulean waves tenderly embraced the pearlescent shores. Taj succumbed to a gripping dread as his limbs betrayed him, relinquishing command over his own body. With a mixture of trepidation and captivated fascination, Taj permitted the memory to unfold, a vivid testament to the origins of his journey. <br><br>

"It was three years ago... Before I strayed from the path..." Taj recollected as his former self peering into the depths of a glowing crystalline orb, an accumulation of nearly five years' toil by all the divine beings of the Choyuni pantheon. Despite the immeasurable might of the Choyuni pantheon and the flourishing paradise of the Choyuni tribe, naught but visions of demise and devastation awaited Taj. "No! This cannot be true..." his prior self muttered, the disconcertingly precise nature of Choyuni's divinatory enchantments amplifying his terror. "I must alert the others!" proclaimed the Taj of the past, "Purple Maize or Choyu shall know what to do!"<br><br>

"Absolutely nothing shall be done!" resonated a resounding voice that reverberated throughout the celestial expanse. "But..." interjected past Taj. "We shall take no action in response. Such is my decree as the supreme authority of the Choyuni pantheon," reiterated Choyu. Bowing his head in resignation, the former Taj dissipated in a blaze of luminosity, a flicker of a plan already taking shape within the recesses of his mind. "I shall undertake this endeavour alone," proclaimed the Taj of old. A soundless cry escaped Taj's lips as he gazed upon his former self. "No! Don’t do it!" he shrieked, yet the apparition of the bygone Taj paid no heed to his warnings. <br><br>

Clad in his resplendent armour, the past Taj burst into the opulent throne chamber of the Choyuni gods, his serrated blade swirling with a tempestuous force of annihilation. The first to succumb was Henry le Bird, the divine emissary, felled by a grievous laceration cleaving across his chest, causing blood and entrails to spill forth from his abdomen. His divine radiance emanated from his corporeal vessel, rivulets of pure potency streaming into the form of the Taj from the past, fortifying him, giving him a glimmer of hope against the impending cataclysm. Next to fall was Marc, the deity of the hunt, his head cleanly severed from his torso before he could even draw his weapon. A downward slash etched a crimson wound upon Purple Maize's shoulder as the latter retaliated with a seismic blow, hurtling the former Taj into a sturdy marble pillar. Taj winced as he bore witness to the battle waged by his former self, each strike endured by his former self echoing phantom agonies within his psyche. The remainder of the skirmish transpired in an instant, with Choyu and Purple Maize expelling Taj from the realm of the gods in a millisecond time, while enduring grievous wounds and losing a substantial portion of their divine power to Taj's ferocious onslaught. <br><br>

The memory faded as Taj's consciousness drifted through the boundless void once more. Although the vision had faded, the subsequent chain of events had etched itself indelibly into Taj's mind. Despite having stolen the powers of innumerable deities after obliterating his own pantheon, Taj found himself impotent in the face of the unfolding apocalypse, as an unending horde of mythical beasts surged forth. These monstrous abominations laid waste to almost the entirety of the planet, obliterating millennia of human civilization and reducing the world to a desolate desert. "How naive I was in those bygone days..." Taj reminisced, his thoughts lingering on the profound realization. "Despite all my endeavours, I was utterly powerless..."<br><br>

Death stalked Taj as he prowled through the barren desert. A week had passed since he had awoken from his coma, Taj’s stomach grumbled for sustenance and his parched lips yearned for water. However, the boundless sands provided him with neither. Taj’s waning divine energy barely able to sustain his rapidly degrading body. “Is this how I die?” He thought bitterly, “Alone in the desert with nobody around, loathed by the entire world…” Shaking a fist at the heavens, Taj shouted deliriously. “Damn you god! I hate you!” Taj roared with rage, unaware that god had died by his hand long ago. <br><br>


After what seemed to be an eternity, Taj stood as a mere spectre, his once towering presence now reduced to a frail and ethereal silhouette that seemed to meld with the searing sun. Every step he took was an agonizing quest, his emaciated frame bore the weight of countless sins. Hideous maroon scars adorned his gaunt figure, their repulsive presence accentuated by the sickly yellow pus that oozed from their depths. The relentless heat beat down upon him, high-energy ultraviolet radiation piercing through the wispy remnants of the beleaguered ozone layer to bore into his flesh, intent on tormenting his weary soul. <br><br>

Through the shifting sands, Taj trudged on, his weakened limbs waging a valiant struggle against the invisible shackles of pain and exhaustion. The desert, a silent and remorseless accomplice to his suffering, whispered secrets of desolation into the wind, its voice carrying the weight of a thousand forsaken hopes. Its lifeless grains, like merciless invaders, found their way into every crevice of Taj's existence, an unwelcome reminder of his perpetual torment. <br><br>

Amidst this bleak landscape, Taj's voice, barely a whisper, escaped his parched lips in a murmured soliloquy. "They once dubbed this place as the plains of infinite knowledge..." His words lingered in the air, almost swallowed by the vast emptiness that surrounded him. "I have traversed its barren realms for eons, yet the light of enlightenment remains elusive. Was it all a grand illusion? Was my existence nothing more than a side character crafted solely to fuel Shan-Mei's growth? But wait... How did such a preposterous notion take root in my fractured mind? It resembles something Choyu would concoct in one of his trashy fanfictions." Taj's delirious ramblings persisted long into the night, their echoes blending harmoniously with the mournful howls of the desert wind. Each breath he took, shallow and ragged, became an opportunity for him to delve into the depths of his desolation. <br><br>

The silence of the desert mocked Taj's fervent yearning, its boundless expanses reflecting his profound insignificance despite the grandeur of his past achievements. The biting wind, relentless and merciless, clawed at his tattered garments, as if attempting to peel away the remnants of his former self. It served as a cruel reminder of the penance he had yet to pay, an insatiable debt to a forsaken world that demanded his suffering as recompense for his existence. And so, Taj pressed on, his weary footsteps leaving an indelible mark upon the ever-shifting sands. <br><br>

n the vast expanse of the desert, Taj found himself grappling with the immense weight of his haunting past. The moon, with its ethereal glow, stretched its elongated shadows across the desolate sands, casting an eerie atmosphere upon the scene. His thoughts wandered aimlessly, descending into an abyss of his own creation, as memories of his life as Taj the terrorist demon, the bringer of chaos and destruction, tormented his every waking moment. <br><br>

The faces of his victims, their once joyful countenances now etched with despair, plagued Taj's conscience, their anguished cries reverberating through the vast landscape of his mind. Amidst the frigid wasteland that mirrored the frostiness of his own heart, a flicker of doubt emerged from the depths of Taj's fractured psyche. He couldn't help but question what had driven him to commit such heinous acts, to embrace his role as a purveyor of pain and suffering. <br><br>

"It was the only way!" Taj retorted sharply, a smouldering ember of his former determination reigniting in the hidden recesses of his mind. "It was necessary!" Yet, in the desolation of his solitary journey, the echoes of his past deeds grew louder, demanding answers he could no longer ignore. Within the labyrinth of his thoughts, a traitorous voice whispered, its insidious tone cutting through the chaos of his mind. <br><br>

As Taj trudged on, his steps weighted with the burden of his sins, the desert itself seemed to speak in hushed tones of regret and remorse. The winds, once his accomplice in suffering, now carried with them fragments of shattered lives, casting shadows of doubt upon the path he had once fervently believed in. "You failed," the voices whispered, their words lacing Taj's judgment with uncertainty. "Despite all the stolen power you possessed, you lost. Yet that town still stands. They managed what you couldn’t. Despite your overwhelming power, they triumphed while you suffered defeat." <br><br>

In the midst of his existential turmoil, a fragile seed of realization took root within Taj's heart. The cracks in his unwavering conviction began to widen, allowing rays of truth to penetrate his hardened exterior. Like dissipating fog in the morning sun, Taj's shroud of lies and delusion slowly cracked, leaving behind a yearning for redemption, a desperate desire to atone for the unforgivable atrocities he had committed. The flicker of doubt that had once danced within him now transformed into an ember of hope, illuminating his path forward. <br><br>

With each arduous step, Taj's yearning for redemption burned brighter within him. He longed to seize the opportunity to rewrite the narrative of his existence, to alter the course of his own history. The realization that he had been walking the wrong path, serving as an instrument of destruction, filled him with an unyielding determination to seek forgiveness and heal the fractures he had caused. <br><br>

As the radiant morning sun ascended slowly over the barren landscape, Taj sought an opportunity to undo the irreparable, to construct a future steeped in healing and restoration. His footsteps echoed resolutely across the desert, resonating with newfound purpose. Redemption called to him like an oasis on the distant horizon, promising to quench the thirst of his remorse and guide him towards absolution. <br><br>

In the crucible of his own self-reflection, Taj resolved to become an agent of change, leaving behind the darkness that had once consumed him. He embarked upon the arduous path of redemption, his journey guided by the flickering light of hope. With each stride, Taj forged ahead, driven by an unwavering resolve to transform himself, to cast aside his role as a harbinger of destruction, and to embrace the potential for healing and restoration. <br><br>

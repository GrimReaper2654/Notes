**Taj Lore:** <br>
A cataclysmic explosion tore apart the boundless desert, unleashing an enormous storm of fiery rage into the skies. The tranquil heavens, once adorned with celestial hues, were engulfed by an unforgiving inferno, radiating a brilliant and scorching light. An ominous shockwave, a relentless behemoth, surged forth like a monstrous tidal wave of annihilation, obliterating everything in its path. The earth convulsed in violent spasms, trembling in terror beneath the insatiable power of the detonation. Majestic peaks on the opposite side of the world crumbled like ancient titans conceding to their ultimate defeat, their lofty summits dissolving into the tumultuous winds. Seas writhed in agonizing turmoil, their once serene countenance transformed into seething cauldrons of fury, colossal tidal waves advancing with voracity, greedily consuming the remnants of past civilizations. <br><br>

A solitary entity tumbled through the stratosphere, its appendages enshrouded in the remnants of fiery devastation. Adorning its form were colossal lacerations that traversed its torso, exuding a torrential cascade of blood. In the aftermath of his ignominious defeat suffered at the merciless hands of Purple Maize, an overwhelming torrent of shame and impotence assailed Taj, encapsulating his being as he persisted in his suborbital descent. Unfathomable torment surged unabated, ravaging his very nerves as the vestiges of holy energy from the deity's assault continued to ravage the terrorist’s enfeebled corporeal existence, the emanation of his own demonic power dissipating into the ethereal realm. A veritable deluge of scarlet liquid spewed forth from his oral cavity and auricles, manifesting a sanguine river that marred the sky's expanse. A spine-chilling, vociferous bellow of anguish erupted from Taj's maw as the terrain loomed menacingly beneath him, its jagged protrusions and thorny shrubbery poised to exacerbate his already grievous wounds. In the grip of imminent unconsciousness, Taj's consciousness succumbed, while an immense column of dust and soil erupted forth into the atmosphere, heralding his undignified homecoming to the terrestrial plane. <br><br>

"Too weak... Too slow... Too foolish... I was never strong enough," Taj lamented, the softly spoken yet resolute phrases resonating within the depths of his consciousness. "I never stood a chance." The impenetrable, lightless void enveloping Taj's mind shifted, with the murky haze receding to unveil a familiar tableau, a remnant of a bygone era. The luxuriant foliage of Choyuni island sprawled around him, while the cerulean waves tenderly embraced the pearlescent shores. Taj succumbed to a gripping dread as his limbs betrayed him, relinquishing command over his own body. With a mixture of trepidation and captivated fascination, Taj permitted the memory to unfold, a vivid testament to the origins of his journey. <br><br>

"It was three years ago... Before I strayed from the path..." Taj recollected as his former self peering into the depths of a glowing crystalline orb, an accumulation of nearly five years' toil by all the divine beings of the Choyuni pantheon. Despite the immeasurable might of the Choyuni pantheon and the flourishing paradise of the Choyuni tribe, naught but visions of demise and devastation awaited Taj. "No! This cannot be true..." his prior self muttered, the disconcertingly precise nature of Choyuni's divinatory enchantments amplifying his terror. "I must alert the others!" proclaimed the Taj of the past, "Purple Maize or Choyu shall know what to do!"<br><br>

"Absolutely nothing shall be done!" resonated a resounding voice that reverberated throughout the celestial expanse. "But..." interjected past Taj. "We shall take no action in response. Such is my decree as the supreme authority of the Choyuni pantheon," reiterated Choyu. Bowing his head in resignation, the former Taj dissipated in a blaze of luminosity, a flicker of a plan already taking shape within the recesses of his mind. "I shall undertake this endeavour alone," proclaimed the Taj of old. A soundless cry escaped Taj's lips as he gazed upon his former self. "No! Don’t do it!" he shrieked, yet the apparition of the bygone Taj paid no heed to his warnings. <br><br>

Clad in his resplendent armour, the past Taj burst into the opulent throne chamber of the Choyuni gods, his serrated blade swirling with a tempestuous force of annihilation. The first to succumb was Henry le Bird, the divine emissary, felled by a grievous laceration cleaving across his chest, causing blood and entrails to spill forth from his abdomen. His divine radiance emanated from his corporeal vessel, rivulets of pure potency streaming into the form of the Taj from the past, fortifying him, giving him a glimmer of hope against the impending cataclysm. Next to fall was Marc, the deity of the hunt, his head cleanly severed from his torso before he could even draw his weapon. A downward slash etched a crimson wound upon Purple Maize's shoulder as the latter retaliated with a seismic blow, hurtling the former Taj into a sturdy marble pillar. Taj winced as he bore witness to the battle waged by his former self, each strike endured by his former self echoing phantom agonies within his psyche. The remainder of the skirmish transpired in an instant, with Choyu and Purple Maize expelling Taj from the realm of the gods in a millisecond time, while enduring grievous wounds and losing a substantial portion of their divine power to Taj's ferocious onslaught. <br><br>

The memory faded as Taj's consciousness drifted through the boundless void once more. Although the vision had faded, the subsequent chain of events had etched itself indelibly into Taj's mind. Despite having stolen the powers of innumerable deities after obliterating his own pantheon, Taj found himself impotent in the face of the unfolding apocalypse, as an unending horde of mythical beasts surged forth. These monstrous abominations laid waste to almost the entirety of the planet, obliterating millennia of human civilization and reducing the world to a desolate desert. "How naive I was in those bygone days..." Taj reminisced, his thoughts lingering on the profound realization. "Despite all my endeavours, I was utterly powerless..."<br><br>

Death stalked Taj as he prowled through the barren desert. A week had passed since he had awoken from his coma, Taj’s stomach grumbled for sustenance and his parched lips yearned for water. However, the boundless sands provided him with neither. Taj’s waning divine energy barely able to sustain his rapidly degrading body. “Is this how I die?” He thought bitterly, “Alone in the desert with nobody around, loathed by the entire world…” Shaking a fist at the heavens, Taj shouted deliriously. “Damn you god! I hate you!” Taj roared with rage, unaware that god had died by his hand long ago. <br><br>

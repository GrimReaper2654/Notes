**Spicata Lore**<br>
In the boundless recesses of Spicata's consciousness, a mesmerizing maelstrom of turbulent energy raged with an untamed fury, unleashing ethereal tendrils intricately woven with resplendent strands of amethyst lightning. This enigmatic entity had dedicated an eternity to the tireless pursuit of self-mastery. With unwavering resolve, he relentlessly honed the boundless faculties of his prodigious mind, delving deep into the very essence that permeated his ethereal abode. Recursively ascending the heights of his own cognition, Spicata's thoughts approached infinity itself, orchestrating entire simulated universes that flickered into existence and vanished in the span of a nanosecond. Amidst the ceaseless tempest that ravaged the innermost sanctums of his mind, his focus remained unwavering, his indomitable will acting as an eternal sculptor, chiselling away at the untapped reservoirs of latent might slumbering within his being. <br><br>

Across the unfathomable eons, time slipped away like whispers through the delicate glass of his existence. Deep within the serpentine corridors of his own psyche, Spicata embarked on an unending odyssey, his consciousness metamorphosing into an ethereal realm of celestial omnipotence. As he traversed these ethereal corridors, visions of cosmic wonders and profound secrets hidden within the fabric of his being emerged, the unfathomable depths of existence unveiled to Spicata’s omnipotent mind. <br><br>

As Spicata’s corporeal vessel lay in a state of comatose repose on the weathered porch of his humble abode, Spicata's ethereal essence soared beyond the constraints of mortal limitations. In the vast expanse of his subconsciousness, enigmatic experiments and intricate simulations unfurled with dazzling complexity. It was within this realm that a majestic utopia took shape, born of the very fabric of his boundless imagination—a utopia that stood as a stark juxtaposition to the desolate reality in which he resided. <br><br>

Within the boundless expanse of his ethereal creation, Spicata beheld a realm of transcendent beauty, a symphony of vivid landscapes stretching to the limits of perception. he marvelled at the sight of majestic mountains, their peaks shrouded in the radiant hues of an eternal dawn, casting an otherworldly glow upon the celestial tapestry. Veritable oases of life, the lush forests flourished with exotic flora, their ethereal petals glistening like shimmering stardust, their fragrance lingering in the air as a sweet caress carried by a phantom breeze. <br><br>

Tranquil rivers gracefully meandered through the verdant valleys, their crystalline waters flowing with a quietude that seemed to whisper ancient secrets, their melodic murmurs dancing over the pebbled beds. Nature's symphony echoed through this utopian land, a harmonious symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves, serenading the senses with its sublime melody. <br><br>

Yet, amidst this idyllic splendour, a profound emptiness permeated the very fabric of Spicata's creation. Despite the perfection surrounding him, an undeniable void lingered, casting a pall over his own paradise. For even within this utopia, Spicata found himself burdened with an undeniable solitude. <br><br>

Thus, with a mere thought, Spicata extended a tendril of divine might, reaching back into the realm of reality, tainted by the relentless grip of death and decay. With determination as his guide, he embarked on a mission to salvage the few remaining souls, plucking them from the clutches of oblivion, and ushering them into his internal world. "They'll each have 9 lives" Spicata decided, "I hope they'll put them to good use."<br><br>

"It is time," Spicata whispered to himself, his voice reverberating through the ethereal realm, "to initiate a grand rebirth, a restoration of all that has been lost." In an act of extraordinary selflessness, he sealed away the majority of his omnipotent power, a sacrifice made in the pursuit of a new reality, unburdened by the shackles of malevolence and corruption. <br><br>

Edward, Dasindu, Mace, Spicata, Joel, Choyu, Reaper, Shan-Mei and Loren found themselves atop the crest of a gentle hill, gazes fixed on the breathtaking sight before them: a sprawling, verdant valley destined to become their cherished abode. Below them, a tranquil creek meandered gracefully through the landscape, while a regal oak forest stood tall, offering the promise of abundant lumber for their future residences. The fertile soil beneath their feet nurtured a kaleidoscope of vibrant flowers that painted the terrain with an enchanting tapestry of colors as contented cows and playful sheep frolicked joyfully amidst the lush grass. <br><br>

As they breathed in the pure, refreshing air, the hilltop seemed to whisper stories of new beginnings, inviting the adventurers to etch their own chapter into the annals of history. The possibilities stretched out like the vast horizon, beckoning them to weave their lives intricately with the rhythms of nature and the beauty of the valley. <br><br>

However, not months after the rebirth of the world, civilisation strayed from Spicata's grand vision. Without their past memories, greed and desire drove the former towners. Blood and gore littered the cobblestone paths of the settlement, a cruel reminder of the countless murders committed by Spicata himself. Armed with a enchanted crossbow and an army of hounds at his fingertips, Spicata was unstoppable, a bloodthirthy tyrant ruling over the settlement dubbed Spawn Town. Under Spicata's rule, the citizens suffered. Joel plummeted to his death multiple times, staining the jagged spikes of Spicata's pitfall trap crimson with his own blood. Choyu died once to a crossbow bolt through the head, part of Spicata's new marketing scheme. Dasindu suffered as Spicata's stress toy, his body multilated by Spicata's iron blade. <br><br>

Edward fled through the snow capped mountains, clutching his only posessions to his chest as Spicata relentlessly persued him, his blade yearning for Edward's blood. Shards of ice and snow battered Edward's dimunitive form, leaving bloody cuts and gashes across his exposed skin. The barking of Spicata's wolves subsided behind him, lost to the vicious howl of the blizzard. Putting one threadbare boot infront of the other, Edward slowly trudged up another mountain, seeking refuge from his persuers and the storm. <br><br>

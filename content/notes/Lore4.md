**TOOMwn lore**<br>
The radiant morning sun, adorned in a cloak of golden tendrils, ascended majestically, casting its effulgent rays upon the slumbering landscape below. The OOM town emerged from the obsidian-laden embrace of the desert, adorned with buildings wrought predominantly from the resplendent luster of quartz and obsidian. At the heart of this desert oasis, the crowning jewel, a prodigious tower sculpted from the darkest obsidian, stood tall and proud, commanding reverence and admiration. This monumental edifice, the abode of the esteemed mayor, served as a testament to the town's refined tastes and enduring legacy. Encircling the town, formidable walls of obsidian stood sentinel, shielding the idyllic haven from the treacherous unknown beyond. For beyond these fortress-like barriers, an ominous tale unfurled—a trepidation-inducing realm where demonic beasts prowled and roamed with an insatiable hunger amidst the ruddy embrace of the desert's red sands. <br><br>

Restless strides carried Edward ceaselessly across the expanse of the topmost floor within the imposing confines of the mayor's tower. Each step reverberated like an unyielding echo, while the lingering cadence of Spicata's ominous words resounded with crystalline clarity in his mind's ear. "I saw everything," those five haunting syllables had fallen from the enigmatic lips, their weight etching a trail of enigma in Edward's thoughts. Confounding perplexity wove an intricate tapestry upon his countenance, casting an enigmatic shadow upon his furrowed brow, while his newly acquired mantle of mayoral authority seemed to offer no solace in unravelling the cryptic enigma that had been cast upon him. The untamed wilderness of uncertainty clawed at his consciousness as he found himself absently scratching his chin, an instinctive yet futile attempt to coax forth understanding from the depths of his ruminations. How vast was the expanse of Spicata's knowledge? What secrets did he hold within the recesses of his enigmatic being? The visage of Spicata, perched eerily upon his front porch, a glass of orange juice clasped nonchalantly in his grasp, assaulted Edward's thoughts once more, a phantom spectre that defied explanation. Edward shook his head in a futile attempt to banish the intrusive recollection, the determined motion a desperate plea for mental clarity amidst the swirling tempest of uncertainty that threatened to engulf him. <br><br>

Fortuitously, a ray of respite pierced through the enigmatic shroud that enveloped the newly anointed mayor, for at that moment, Shan-Mei, the object of Edward's fervent affections, appeared within the chamber, burdened by a stack of papers. Alas, the fickle hand of fate chose to sow seeds of distress, as the words that danced upon her lips bore an unsettling message. "Edward," she began, her voice laden with urgency, "a formidable throng of demonic beasts advances inexorably in our direction. Choyu has disclosed their identities as none other than Aemam, Aemas, Aeche, and Aeeng, enigmatic entities preserved within the cryptic pages of volumes two, three, and five of the hallowed Choyuni manuscripts respectively. We must promptly assemble our defences and ready ourselves for the impending siege. What are your commands, Edward?" Her words hung in the air like suspended breath, a fervent plea to the newly appointed mayor to orchestrate the intricate ballet of fortification that would strive to repel the encroaching darkness. <br><br>

As the weight of the grim revelation settled upon Edward's consciousness, a profound realization dawned with unsettling clarity. "It seems that the veils of the apocalypse have descended upon us, hastening their arrival far sooner than anticipated. I had hoped for respite, a few more fleeting years to steel our resolve." His voice resonated with a sage-like profundity, each word laden with the weight of sombre understanding. A flicker of suspicion, like a flame dancing in the recesses of his mind, flickered to life. "An imposter may lurk among us, their nefarious machinations beckoning the very forces that now converge upon our sanctuary." With a stoic determination etched upon his countenance, Edward's sagacious proclamation echoed through the chamber, reverberating with an unwavering resolve. "However, we shall not falter in the face of this encroaching chaos. With every fibre of our beings, we shall defend our cherished town, prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, if need be." Rising from his seat, the newly enlightened mayor assumed a posture of leadership, beckoning Shan-Mei to accompany him on their treacherous mission. "No longer shall we cower in the shadows of fear. We shall rise, fortified by unwavering courage, and march forth to alert our fellow citizens of the imminent peril that besets us." A sense of urgency propelled Edward forward, his determined strides echoing in tandem with his unwavering resolve. The journey began as they departed the tower, guided by the gravity of their duty, an indomitable spirit igniting their steps as they embarked upon the perilous quest to sound the clarion call of warning to the towners, ignorant of the looming danger. <br><br>

Amidst the searing desert air, the townspeople gathered, their collective breath held in anticipation of Edward's impending proclamation. With an air of supreme confidence, he towered over them, his voice resonating through the town square. "Prepare yourselves, simpletons, for the unveiling of incontrovertible truths that transcend your limited comprehension," Edward declared. "Behold, for I shall illuminate the imminent convergence of cataclysmic forces upon our esteemed sanctuary—a symphony of havoc orchestrated by entities of such profound potency that their power surpasses even terrorist god." <br><br>

A dissident voice disrupted the air, vainly attempting to disrupt Edward's grandiloquent soliloquy. "Fake news!" it cried, a feeble attempt to corrode the foundation of his exalted knowledge. But the murmurs of dissent were swiftly neutralized, their acidic scepticism neutralized by a deluge of disdainful glares from the mesmerized crowd. Sensing the submission of the masses, Edward seized the opportunity to continue his monologue. "Together, my intellectual inferiors, we shall defeat this approaching apocalypse. We shall train relentlessly and arm ourselves with the finest weaponry, for within weeks the apocalypse shall commence. We shall prevail, for I am leading you." <br><br>

Beneath the veneer of unwavering arrogance, however, Edward's inner mind churned with volatile uncertainty. "Have I chosen the most potent of words? The burden of commanding the masses is as precarious as a finely balanced equilibrium reaction," he conceded, a mere whisper of vulnerability betraying the tumultuous mixture of hubris and doubt that seethed within him. <br><br>

All of a sudden, the sky turned pitch black as a gigantic whirlpool of chaos ripped open a gaping hole in the air. Fierce bolts of purple lightning crackled and thundered through the atmosphere as wicked tendrils of darkness emerged from the portal, reaching for anything in their path. A cacophony of horrified screams filled the air as the panic-stricken townspeople fled in all directions, desperately seeking refuge. “How is this happening so soon!” Edward thought with dread, “The ancient Choyuni scrolls predicted that we had weeks to prepare!” <br><br>

Ascending the precipice of the formidable obsidian rampart with unwavering resolve, Edward beheld an assemblage of unspeakable abominations that ceaselessly swarmed across the desolate expanse of the arid desert, their fangs, and talons aglint under the baleful glow of the immense portals. Spawned from the churning vortexes, these grotesque entities materialized, their repugnant physiognomies eclipsing the sun. Beside him, his triumvirate of most trusted confidants stood resolute, primed to safeguard the besieged township with unyielding fortitude. Lofty in stature (at least when compared to him), JLee projected an imposing presence, his circular spectacles catching the luminous flickers emanating from his blazing quartz blade, while his robust sinews rippled beneath the resplendent armour crafted from gold and gleaming quartz. Positioned at his left flank, Reaper bore a subtle grin, adroitly twirling his lethal scythe in his dexterous grasp. Meanwhile, Shan-Mei, defying expectation, clung to a grand piano, an instrument-turned-arsenal, as the demonic horde surged relentlessly toward the dwindling bastion of human existence. United through years of shared adversities and countless perilous encounters, Edward entrusted his compatriots with a bond surpassing mere camaraderie—they were a kinship, a cherished familial extension (apart from Shan-Mei, she’s Edward’s girlfriend). Affirming his trust with a grim, yet resolute smile, Edward nodded to his valiant comrades, cognizant that they would pledge unswerving fealty unto the bitter end. Coalescing into a synchronized motion, the guardians of humanity defiantly launched themselves from their vantage point, a torrent of monstrous adversaries converging upon them as they soared through the air. <br><br>

Unyielding in his resolve, Edward surged forth, clutching vials brimming with lethal alchemical concoctions. With a resounding battle cry that reverberated through the sprawling expanse of the war-torn field, his commanding voice rang out, saturating the atmosphere with tenacity. "Suck my hydrocarbons!" In a cataclysmic display, incendiary napalm erupted from his volatile flasks, eradicating feeble adversaries as their weathered hides succumbed to the relentless onslaught of devouring flames. The razor-edged claws and serrated fangs of vile creatures clashed futilely against the impervious barrier of Edward's divine-class obsidian armour, shattering upon impact with a futile resonance. The battleground was ensnared in a miasma of noxious vapours as Edward, with deft precision, uncorked a flask, unleashing gaseous chemicals that seared the eyes and lungs of the chaotic horde, their existence consumed by torment. <br><br>

JLee and Reaper, exemplars of martial prowess, cleaved through the endless legions of monstrosities, their blades traversing organic armour and bone like a hot knife through butter. Shan-Mei, positioned strategically in the rear ranks, emanated a translucent veil of regal purple energy from her cherished amulet, a sanctuary safeguarding her from imminent harm. In sporadic intervals, the amethyst pendant clasped within her hands radiated an ethereal luminescence, invoking protective enchantments that graced her valiant comrades. Nevertheless, despite their unwavering determination, the iniquitous forces of darkness exerted a steady, remorseless advance, gradually forcing the stalwart defenders of humanity to concede ground. <br><br>

From the heart of the battlefield, an awe-inspiring conflagration of luminosity erupted, an incandescent burst that engulfed the senses and overwhelmed mortal perceptions. Its brilliance, akin to a supernova unleashed in all its resplendent glory, bathed the tumultuous theatre in an ethereal radiance, while an unfathomable potency surged forth, unleashing a cataclysmic shockwave that rent the very fabric of reality. In its wake, the disintegrated remains of innumerable demonic entities were propelled through the heavens, their shattered forms drifting aimlessly amidst the cascading ethereal particles that danced amidst the air currents. <br><br>

The deafening roar of the resulting shockwave reverberated through the ears of the defenders, their ears assailed by waves of tormenting dissonance. Shaken and disoriented, they hastily converged behind the hastily erected barrier conjured by the mystically inclined Shan-Mei, a wavering veil of pulsating violet luminescence barely retaining sufficient structural integrity to endure the relentless assault of the shockwave's fury. It stood as a frail bastion against the inexorable forces of devastation, a meagre defence manifesting against the overpowering surge. <br><br>

Unyielding in their relentless offensive, another salvo tore asunder the infernal ranks, an orchestrated symphony of obliteration. A sphere of superheated plasma burning at 60 million degrees burst forth, a seething torrent that voraciously devoured the corrupted flesh and fractured skeletal structures of the vile demons as sixteen nanograms of positrons mutually annihilated with the surrounding matter amidst the forces of chaos. <br><br>

High atop the impenetrable obsidian fortifications, the stalwart figure of Dasindu stood, his tanned muscles rippling as he retargeted his weapon. With unflinching resolve, his finger pressed firmly against the trigger of the colossal fifty-meter positron cannon, a marvel of technological ingenuity. It hummed with an electrifying energy, coursing through its colossal frame, while intricate systems synchronized with precision, preparing to unleash yet another maelstrom of annihilative force upon the teeming hordes below. Flanking him with an air of technical proficiency, Choyu and Mace laboured relentlessly, their skilled hands deftly replacing the various fuses and intricately woven cables within the innards of the awe-inspiring weapon, a synchronized dance of intricate motions as they ensured its impeccable functionality. Calculations flashed through their mind as they fine-tuned the weapon’s trajectory to strike another unsuspecting mob of hideous abominations. As they worked, capacitors hummed with resonant power, steadily building their energy reserves in readiness for the impending storm that awaited release. A symphony of arcane technology, fortified by human ingenuity, poised to wreak havoc upon the abominable adversaries that dared encroach upon the precipice of humanity's final bastion. <br><br>

As the relentless onslaught of feeble demons gradually abated, the horizon birthed a fearsome sight to behold—several colossal figures emerged, casting their ominous silhouettes against the waning light. The quartet of the prophesied harbingers of apocalyptic devastation ominously advanced, their colossal presence reverberating through the very foundation of the earth. Leading the unholy charge was Aeche, a towering titan of unfathomable scale, an awe-inspiring fusion of chemical compounds, reaching an astounding zenith of two hundred meters. From its monstrous frame, a deluge of vile slime and toxic sludge oozed incessantly, dripping with a malevolent viscosity that whispered of decay and corruption. <br><br>

To its left, Aeeng lurked, a creature of eldritch terrors unbound, its skin resembling the ethereal translucence of glass. A macabre dance of rippling aberrations played out beneath its translucent exterior, a manifestation of unfathomable cosmic horrors that gnawed at the fringes of sanity. Within the depths of its form, the visages of damned souls writhed in eternal torment, their countenances twisted into grotesque expressions of abject terror and agonizing suffering. <br><br>

On the opposing flank, the distorted visage of Aemam drifted ominously through the air, a distorted phantasm defying the very fabric of reality. Within its enigmatic being, mathematical equations danced with a discordant elegance, contorting the very essence of existence and warping the laws that governed the mortal plane. The veils of perception and reason were rendered naught in its presence, as indefinite integrals and discrete random variables danced beyond mortal comprehension. <br><br>

Looming steadfastly at the rear of this monstrous coterie, Aemas, a being of arcane enigma, resided. Obscured within a swirling maelstrom of cryptic symbols and esoteric sigils, 8th dimensional position vectors marked its location, obscured by quantum superposition. Defying all known lays of reality, its multi-dimensional matrixes of data projected into the mortal realm, casting a distorted 6th-dimensional shadow that warped and distorted at several times the speed of light. Its otherworldly aura permeated the battlefield, sending a wave of dread into the minds of those who’s minds are in tune with the flow of mathematical energy. <br><br>

Breaking away from the rest of the defenders, Edward confronted the thundering charge of Aeche, their clash unleashing a maelstrom of volatile forces. His keen mind, honed in the crucible of chemical mastery, swiftly devised a strategy to counter the malevolent entity's toxic onslaught. With a deft flick of his wrist, he unleashed a vial of concentrated sulfuric acid, hurtling through the air with a purposeful trajectory. The potent acid, teeming with protons eager to engage in an electrifying dance of molecular interaction, collided with the colossal embodiment of chemistry, initiating a ferocious reaction. The ionic compounds that comprised the titan's leg bore witness to an aggressive dance of chemical transformation, their pristine lattice structures destabilizing under the relentless assault of acidic corrosion. <br><br>

Undeterred by the explosive tumult ensuing around him, Edward deftly maneuvered through the hazardous battlefield, his nimble footwork evading the retaliatory strikes of Aeche's projectiles that erupted into vehement combustion reactions as they slammed into the bloodstained sand beneath his feet. Drawing upon his formidable arsenal of chemical weaponry, Edward procured a flask brimming with a synthesized compound of nitrogenous base and a potent oxidizing agent. With precision and accuracy, he performed a stoichiometry calculation before unleashing the concoction towards the behemoth, igniting a blazing inferno upon impact. The exothermic reaction between the reactive ingredients consumed Aeche in a massive fireball. However, thermal energy was swiftly lost to the surroundings, leaving Aeche mostly unharmed. <br><br>

In response to the onslaught, the titan harnessed its own elemental arsenal, unleashing a volatile concoction of acidic vapours that billowed forth with malevolent fervour. A malefic fog of toxic gases enveloped the battleground, rendering the air rife with potent acids. Edward, undeterred by the noxious tempest swirling around him, employed his keen understanding of chemical kinetics and reaction rates. Swiftly assessing the volatile composition of Aeche's toxic emissions, he devised a countermeasure rooted in precise understanding. Procuring a specialized catalyst, he dispersed the catalyst's fine particulate matter into the air, initiating a series of intricate surface reactions that neutralized the acidic onslaught. The noxious vapors, stripped of their potency, dissipated into harmless by-products, their deadly nature nullified under the swift application of chemical manipulation. <br><br>

Meanwhile, Reaper, his eyes ablaze with fervor, advanced upon the abhorrent entity known as Aeeng. With an expert flourish, his wicked scythe cleaved through the glasslike visage of his adversary, the eldritch horrors within offering feeble resistance. A bestial roar reverberated through the battlefield as Aeeng, writhing in agony, raised a malevolent tentacle to retaliate. However, before the appendage could strike, JLee, the embodiment of fiery determination, lunged forward, his blazing sword slashing through the monstrous limb with a resounding strike. <br><br>

Yet, in that moment of triumph, the battlefield was inundated with an ethereal surge of otherworldly energy, a torrent of malevolence unleashed from the gaping wound inflicted upon Aeeng. Tendrils of darkness, serpentine in their maleficence, unfurled and snaked their way towards the valiant defenders, threatening to ensnare them in an all-encompassing shroud of eldritch madness. However, JLee, his weapon infused with a divine essence, radiated a holy aura, pulsating with an ethereal luminescence. As the tendrils of darkness made contact, they recoiled and dissipated, consumed by the dissipating mist of righteous light that emanated from the blade. <br><br>

Alas, the same could not be said for Reaper, who found himself engulfed within the insidious embrace of the encroaching darkness. The inky blackness swallowed his cloaked figure, obscuring him from sight as madness clawed at the recesses of his tormented mind. A bloodcurdling scream, laced with sheer terror, reverberated through the air, its chilling resonance permeating the hearts of all who heard it. Within the depths of Aeeng's everchanging form, Reaper's visage vanished, consumed by the abominable entity's eldritch maw. <br><br>

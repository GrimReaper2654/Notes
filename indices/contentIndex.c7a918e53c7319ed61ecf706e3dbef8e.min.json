Its origin shrouded in mystery, Password1 is a testament to the arcane artistry of those who guard the gates of the virtual world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nForged in the crucible of countless forgotten secrets, this remarkable passphrase is said to possess the strength to unlock the most impenetrable doors, both physical and metaphorical. Its potency lies in its deceptive simplicity, for Password1 is the embodiment of a paradox, a union of both vulnerability and invincibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, after decades of relentless development, the most sophisticated os password crackers have evolved to crack even the near invulnerable Password1. Thus Password1 must evolve as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFollowing an arithmatic series, Password1 transformed into Password2, doubling its security in an instant. Password 2 then evolved into Password3, an additional 50% increace in security. The infinite potential of this series surpasses the limited resources of the forces of evil, hackers and scammers seeking to steal your personal information. However, this power came at a great cost, time. While secure, Password42069911 takes almost twice as long to type, therefore greatly reducing its ease of use. Another innovation was necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYears later, after the rediscovery of negative numbers, Password1 evolved again. Instead of a series extending infinitely into the heavens, this new series of passwords desended into the depth of the abyss. Password1 became Password0, which became Password-1, and then Password-2. The addition of a negative symbol perplexed the password crackers, never before had a symbol that wasn't a letter or a number appeared. But even this incredible design suffered the same fate as its predecessor. Password-42069911 was far too long and cumbersome to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis problem plagued password users for years, some even switching away from the Password n series. But finally, with the rediscovery of advanced mathematics, thought to be lost to history, Password1 evolved to its final form, the epitome of password tehcnology. Password0!, Password-i^2, Password-e^iœÄ, Passwordsin^2(x)+cos^2(x). The sheer complexity of these password surpassed mortal comprehesion, password crackers unable to even comprehend the overwhelming power of the variants of Password1. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFinally, a secure enough password for my discord account, with exactly $0 and no prsonal information on it.\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-08T13:09:11.062510505Z","tags":[]},"/notes/experimental1":{"title":"experimental1","content":"**[REDACTED] x [REDACTED2] lore: Chapter 1**\u003cbr\u003e\nIt was a day bathed in sunshine, so warm that it felt as though the sun itself was beaming down to celebrate their fateful encounter. Within the ancient hallways of the Beasly building, [REDACTED2], a year 11 titan, strode confidently towards his economics classroom, woefully unaware that he had computer science instead. The very mention of [REDACTED2]‚Äôs name sent confusion through the student body, as he was sufficiently irrelevant that nobody knew who he was. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd then there was [REDACTED], a year 9 enigma, a shy wisp of stardust that drifted through the sea of adolescent cacophony. Her music, it was said, had the power to soothe even the most unruly of students ([REDACTED2]), and her oboe, when it sang, moved even the emperor of frogs who resided in the dark recesses of BL4. Her notes website brought salvation to hundreds of her underclassmen who worshiped her as their god. And her silence, well, it was an honour to be privy to it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs [REDACTED] gracefully glided through the rampaging hordes of year 7s, heads turned as students and teachers alike gazed upon her beauty. However, one misstep from [REDACTED2] was all it took to send both of them sprawling onto the carpet. Rubbing his concussed head, [REDACTED2] opened his eyes, gazing upon the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. Long jet-black hair framed her porcelain-pale face, as confusion flashed across her warm almond shaped eyes. [REDACTED2], in that instant, was hit by a wave of emotions, \"Is it possible for a girl to be this beautiful?\" he thought to himself, as a blush spread across his face. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n‚ÄúHey! Stop staring, its creepy.‚Äù [REDACTED] berated, a light rosy blush on her cheeks. Snapping out of his delusions, [REDACTED2] intelligently uttered, ‚Äòuh‚Ä¶ sorry?‚Äô as he shakily stood up only to trip over a strategically misplaced schoolbag and tumble back onto the ground, pinning [REDACTED] under his bulky frame. Letting out a girly shriek, [REDACTED] stared up at the woefully mediocre looks of the [REDACTED2]. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kinda cute‚Ä¶‚Äù She thought to herself before rationality kicked in. ‚ÄúGet off me!‚Äù She shrieked, attributing her previous thoughts about [REDACTED2] to her concussion, ‚ÄúEww, pervert, disgusting!‚Äù Unfortunately for [REDACTED2], his room temperature IQ failed to comprehend the current situation, leaving him unconscious right outside the dungeon known as BL4. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPrev Chapter: None\u003cbr\u003e\nNext Chapter: \u003ca href=\"https://cringe.toomwn.xyz/notes/experimental2/\"\u003eChapter2\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-08T13:09:11.062510505Z","tags":[]}}

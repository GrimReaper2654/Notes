The air of resentment was the audience to the monument of dried blood sculpted on the walls. David Wonstein‚Äôs threadbare leather boots stalked soundlessly on the rough granite floor, pacing back and forth amongst the decapitated heads, whose lifeless eyes seemed to stare maliciously at the madman. The headless animals‚Äô bodies sprawled lifelessly across the floor, some thrown to a corner, others discarded in a pile that sat dejectedly amidst a slowly expanding pool of dark blood. The foul stench of death swam in the stale basement air, a vivid memory of the maniac‚Äôs mindless slaughter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTurning to face the motionless body of his experiment, Wonstein ripped open the monstrosity‚Äôs chest with wide deranged eyes, letting its slimy intestines spill over the table like maggots. Immediately, his brown eyes were drawn to the ruptured heart that lay in a lake of blood in the centre of the chest. Its shredded muscles cling feebly to the rotting flesh.\n‚ÄúIt broke again! It broke again! Why did it break again?‚Äù Wonstein roared, glaring at the row of bloodstained glass jars on the dented shelves, ‚ÄúThat was my last one!‚Äù  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWonstein‚Äôs blood boiled as his pale wrinkled skin flushed with a tinge of maroon. Wonstein slammed a gnarled hand on the battered table, shaking the vials of crimson, amber and emerald chemicals. With a cry of rage, his fist clenched around a chipped glass flask, hurling it towards the mossy ground. Glass shards exploded in all directions, as bubbling cyan chemicals erupted from the ruins. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n‚ÄúArggghhhhh!‚Äù The man bellowed crazily, his veins bulging on his forehead, ‚ÄúI need to slay more vermin!‚Äù His leather boots slammed onto the ground, kicking open the heavy door, Wonstein charged into the snowstorm outside. ‚ÄúCome here you filthy beasts!‚Äù he screamed, disregarding the shards of ice slamming into his body. As he swung his hunting rifle in a menacing arc, he trudged through the snow as the wind tore at his leather jacket. Snow fell from the black night, whipped into a blizzard by the howling wind as it roared in anguish, lamenting the slaughter of the innocent within the lab. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n‚ÄúStupid animals!‚Äù ranted Wonstein as he pushed open the lab door, exhausted, ‚ÄúWhere did all the filthy vermin go!‚Äù Throwing his soaked jacket onto the ground, Wonstein sat down on the corpse of a brown bear as the mahogany door slammed shut. \u003cbr\u003e\n‚ÄúI just need one more heart! Why is it so damn hard!‚Äù Wonstein bellowed, pounding the cold granite floor. ‚ÄúI need this! Those old fools shall forever regret saying I‚Äôm crazy! They will behold my power as a god over life and death! They will tremble before my majestic creation!‚Äù \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSuddenly, a small movement in the corner of his eye made Wonstine whip around. Wonstein watched as his dog jumped into his lap, wagging its fluffy tail. Its silky snow-white fur, rubbing warmth into Wonstein‚Äôs frozen legs. Staring at Wonstein with its large brown eyes, its eyes glowed with kindness, like a beacon of light in a dark abyss of despair.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWonsteined smiled. His thin boney hand closed around the thin dog‚Äôs body as he lifted it into the air. A shadow crossed Wonstein‚Äôs face as his lips curved upwards not unlike the smile of a demon as it preyed on a tortured soul. A small whimper escaped the puppy‚Äôs throat. Kicking its legs, the husky struggled futilely as it gazed into the cruel eyes of its executioner, the dog‚Äôs whimpers, now cries of terror. ‚ÄúI almost forgot about you.‚Äù He said as he carried the puppy by the nape of its neck. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n‚ÄúYou shall have the glorious honour of completing my masterpiece!‚Äù laughed Wonstein as he chained the shivering dog on the metal table. Putting on his bloodstained gloves Wonstein opened the metal box containing his tools. Scalpels and carving knives of different shapes and sizes spilled out of the container, some still coated in blood. Selecting a large carving knife that still dripped with the blood of its previous victim, Wonstein raised his blade, its cutting edge glistening evilly in the candlelight, the husky stared at his owner with a look of betrayal like a son dying at the hands of his father.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHolding the fragile red heart, still dripping with warm fresh blood in his hands, Wonstein placed it into the chest of his creation. Slowly combining the components of his masterpiece with a series of stitches, Wonstein stitched together veins and arteries and filled the cavity in his creation with chunks of bloody flesh and bulging muscles. \u003cbr\u003e\n‚ÄúCome alive!‚Äù Commanded the madman as he waved his hands in the air, like a witch casting a curse.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSlowly, the body began to move. Its mismatching legs touched the ground as the monstrosity took its first steps. Wonstein‚Äôs creation shook its bloody fur as its hideous wolf head emitted a bloodcurdling scream. A bloodstained lion claw slashed at Wonstein as he backed away, tripping over the carcass of a small boar. Swinging his arms wildly to keep balance, Wonstien's hand smashed into a table, sending flasks of chemicals and organs of animals into the air. \"Obey me, I am your creator,\" screamed Wonstein, clutching his hand in pain as chemicals rained down upon the monster and scientist. Finding himself face to face with his monster, Wonstein gazed into its cold grey eyes. In his creation's eyes, he saw the same look of pain and fear that he had seen in his dog. Staring at the monster in terror, agony erupted in Wonstein‚Äôs chest as his body was pulverised into a bloody mess of flesh and bone. Wonstein forced out a final cry of pain as his heart was torn from his body.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-11T02:08:41.725340706Z","tags":[]},"/notes/IAmEnglish":{"title":"IAmEnglish","content":"**I Am English: I am Poem**\u003cbr\u003e\nI am the deadlines that I dread, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the pressure that fills my head, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the pages that I must read, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the annotations that I must embed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am the essays that I can't complete, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the grades that can't compete, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the drafts I always delete, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the persuasive essays that become obsolete. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am the stress that consumes my days, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the doubts that cloud my ways, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the exhaustion that never fades, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the burnout that silently invades. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am the pressure to achieve success, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the fear of failure that I suppress, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the frustration when I regress, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the disappointment when I obsess. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am the search for meaning and hope, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the struggle to simply cope, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the emptiness that fills my mind, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the purpose I cannot find, \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am the Year 11 ATAR English student, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the person who's always indolent, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the pain that always burns, \u003cbr\u003e\nI am the pointlessness that still returns. \u003cbr\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-11T02:08:41.725340706Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Lore1":{"title":"Lore1","content":"**Shan-Mei Lore: V1** \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe sprawling urban expanse unfurled out the window of the 69th floor, stretching out to the horizon, like a tapestry woven with the finest strands of concrete and steel. The cityscape emerged from the mountainous terrain, a stunning and vibrant tableau of human endeavour. The gleaming glass facades of the towering high-rise buildings illuminated the maze of streets and alleys into a shimmering mosaic of light and shadow as the afternoon sun cast its rays over the snow-capped mountains in the distance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAmidst the ceaseless bustle and cacophony of the urban metropolis, nestled within the confines of a modest apartment, Shan-Mei sat hunched over a polished mahogany desk. The room was dimly lit by the wan glow of a solitary desk lamp, its flickering light casting ominous shadows upon the cluttered surroundings. Clutching the smooth purple amulet in her hand, as she gazed out at the cityscape beyond, her mind awhirl with creative impulses and unfettered musings. Several sheets of music paper lay scattered haphazardly amidst the cluttered desk, each one bearing the unfinished notes of a symphony yet to be born. Empty paper tea cups and crumpled tissues littered the floor, the remnants of a solitary vigil that had stretched on for hours. With a deep sigh, she pushed aside the dishevelled strands of her hair, closed her eyes, and clasped the amethyst amulet between her lithe fingers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs the iridescent purple amulet rested in Shan-Mei's hand, a wave of transcendental energy surged through her, like a mighty river carving its way through the stony landscape. Enveloped in the talisman's celestial aura, she surrendered herself to the fathomless mysteries of the cosmos, letting the amulet guide her towards a vision of the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd there it was, a macabre symphony of terror and devastation that tore at the very fabric of her soul. The city she called home, once an illustrious tapestry of concrete and steel, had been ravaged by a catastrophic terrorist attack, a fury that had unleashed a torrent of nuclear fire that razed the city to the ground. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe saw the streets, once thronging with life and colour, now reduced to a smouldering wasteland, where the only signs of movement were the dancing tongues of flame that licked at the rubble and the occasional scurrying of mutated insects. The towers that once reached toward the heavens now lay scattered and broken, like shards of glass on a shattered mirror, reflecting only the pain and sorrow that now gripped the land. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd she saw the flames, great, roaring infernos that devoured everything in their path, leaving only destruction and devastation in their wake. The charred visages of her last few remaining friends burnt themselves into her mind, their faces distorted by fear and anguish, as tendrils of flame reached for Shan-Mei, eager to devour her. As the conflagration enveloped her, Shan-Mei braced for the scorching pain, but it never came. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs the vision faded away, Shan-Mei slowly opened her eyes, her consciousness returning to the reality of her small apartment. The familiar surroundings of the room, once so comforting and mundane, now felt oppressive and suffocating. She gasped for breath, her heart racing with a primal fear that refused to subside. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCollapsing to the floor, she clutched the amulet in her trembling hands, desperately trying to make sense of what she had just seen. Was it a warning, a premonition of things to come? Or was it merely a hallucination, a manifestation of her own fears and insecurities? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut as she lay there, lost in thought, a distant rumble jolted her back to the present. It was a sound she had never heard before, a deep, thunderous roar that seemed to shake the very foundations of the earth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe got up, stumbling towards the window, her legs weak and unsteady. And then she saw it, a blinding flash of light that illuminated the sky with an eerie, orange glow. A wave of heat and pressure blasted through the apartment, shattering the glass and throwing her back against the wall. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAscending to a standing position with great haste, Shan-Mei sprang out of shattered window, while a deluge of detritus and pulverized masonry cascaded down from the ceiling like a rainstorm. Muttering a quick prayer to the Choyuni deities with her amulet in hand, a amethyst aura enveloped her lithe frame as she accelerated towards the ground at 9.806 meters per second squared. As her sneakers landed upon the buckling pavement, the aura shattered like glass, millions of fragments disappearing into thin air, as her fall damage was negated. She landed just in time to behold the next barrage of incendiary missiles plummeting towards the metropolis like a swarm of locusts. The scorching temperature and blinding light forced her to cover her eyes as she bolted down the fragmented pavement, skilfully evading the detonations of cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine and fragments of shattered infrastructure that littered the streets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs Shan-Mei fled, a silhouette materialized in the distance, its visage distorted and contorted by the swirling, seething clouds of ash and smoke. It was none other than Taj the Terrorist, a notorious figure whose fanaticism and malice had driven him to perpetrate unspeakable acts of atrocity and annihilation. The malevolent aura emanating from him was palpable, his countenance an ungodly amalgamation of darkness and fury, like a demon rising from the depths of hell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTaj‚Äôs features twisted into a cruel and malevolent sneer, his eyes gleaming with a savage light as he advanced towards Shan-Mei with a cold and calculating menace. Terror gripped Shan-Mei as she stared into Taj‚Äôs sunken eyes which smouldered with a cold, unyielding fire. His movements were fluid and graceful, his body seeming to flow through the wreckage like a wraith as he closed in on his prey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBefore Shan-Mei could muster a response, a searing, blinding pain coursed through her body Her senses were overwhelmed by the jarring sensation of her body hurtling through the air, before her world was abruptly extinguished by a deafening crash. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen she came to, her vision was blurred by the crimson fluid snaking down her face like a river, mingling with the soot and dust that coated her skin. Her limbs were wracked with excruciating pain, and an immense weight crushed down on her legs, Jagged edges of steel and concrete bit into her tender flesh as bright red blood poured out of her numerous wounds. Her screams of anguish, drowned out by the cacophony of explosions and the crackling of flames, went unanswered as her vision dimmed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough her pain-addled haze, she caught a fleeting glimpse of the terrorist, his malevolent smirk taunting her from the distance. He vanished into the inferno as darkness claimed her once again. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs the sun retreated beyond the horizon, a somber darkness cloaked the desolated city. The mangled streetlights flickered dimly, casting their light through a sickly green radioactive haze over the rubble, illuminating Edward's path as he tirelessly searched for survivors amidst the wreckage. Suddenly, a faint cry for help seized his attention, compelling him to investigate. As he traced the origin of the sound, his eyes were met with a scene of devastation. A diminutive teenage girl lay crumpled on the ground, her feeble whimpers filling the silence like a mournful dirge. The sight of her injuries pierced Edward's heart like a serrated knife. Despite his limited medical knowledge, he knew that her wounds were near fatal. Without a moment's hesitation, he rushed to her side, extending his hand to her. \"Come with me. I can heal you,\" he spoke in a deep voice that reverberated through the scorched husks of the nearby buildings. \"I can take you to a safe haven, far away from this nightmare.\" Shan-Mei weakly nodded her head in agreement, and with that, Edward carefully lifted her into his arms, disappearing into the obscurity of the night. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe sands of time continued their relentless march forward, and days blurred together into an ephemeral tapestry. After, Shan-Mei recuperated from her injuries, she adjusted to her new life in Edward's quaint town quite well. She soon discovered that she had stumbled upon a vibrant cast of eccentric characters. There was Reaper, a man with an unwavering passion for military aircraft that bordered on the obsessive, and Edward, a man with a home constructed entirely out of obsidian, who had amassed an astonishing knowledge of chemistry. Then there was Choyu, a curiously intriguing individual with a peculiar fascination with writing Shan-Mei Lore and making strange computer games. Despite their peculiarities, the townsfolk were an incredibly hospitable and warm-hearted group of people, welcoming Shan-Mei with open arms into their community. In this newfound haven, she felt a sense of belonging that she had never experienced in the city. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnder Edward's skilled guidance, Shan-Mei embarked on the daunting task of reconstructing her home, using .md files and markdown. Despite the gruelling and time-consuming nature of the process, Shan-Mei found immense joy in the project. Every day was a new adventure, as she worked tirelessly to erect new rooms, meticulously crafting them with a deft hand and an artist's eye for detail. She adorned her abode with the finest decor and furnishings, each piece chosen with care, and arranged in a manner that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Despite the isolated and barren nature of the surrounding desert, Shan-Mei found a sense of serenity in the quietude, as though the tranquil stillness of the desert was a balm that soothed her aching soul. The desert was like a vast, sprawling canvas, punctuated by the occasional bloom of a wildflower or the darting flight of a bird. In this idyllic setting, Shan-Mei was free to create her own sanctuary, a place where she could rebuild her life with a renewed sense of purpose and hope. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, Shan-Mei could not shake off the gnawing feeling that Taj's return was inevitable. She knew that he would stop at nothing to annihilate what little remained of the city, and thus she embarked on a rigorous regimen of training, working tirelessly to hone her skills and fortify her body and mind. She engaged in rigorous martial arts training, perfecting her technique and refining her combat tactics with the aid of the astute Reaper, whose military expertise was invaluable in the face of the impending threat. Shan-Mei also honed her magical prowess, delving deep into the arcane mysteries of her amulet, seeking to unlock its full potential as a weapon. And yet, despite the preparations and the fortifications, the threat of Taj's return loomed over them like a thunderhead on the horizon, casting a pall of uncertainty over their oasis. The townspeople worked tirelessly, fortifying their community against the impending onslaught. Towering obsidian walls and glistening quartz towers rose from the sands, seemingly impenetrable as all forms of projectile weapons protruded from the ramparts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDespite Shan-Mei's meticulous preparations, Taj's return was an unbridled cataclysm of destruction. Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, like fiery harbingers of doom, rained down from the heavens, unleashing apocalyptic nuclear devastation that encircled the fortified oasis in a deadly embrace. As the air grew thick with the acrid stench of sulfur and ash, hordes of clones and hired mercenaries descended upon the town like a pack of ravening wolves, their savage fury unleashed in a hail of rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire that tore into the crumbling obsidian wall with ferocious intensity, sending jagged shards of glass-like rock flying in all directions. The once-peaceful town was transformed into a chaotic battlefield, the echoes of gunfire and the screams of the wounded reverberating through the air like a haunting dirge of despair. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEdward and Reaper emerged from the chaos, their faces set in grim determination as they charged headlong towards the maniacal Taj, wielding flasks of volatile chemicals and Reaper's ominous scythe. Taj, the terrorist, met their fierce onslaught head-on, his modified machine gun spitting out depleted uranium rounds at hypersonic speeds, unleashing a blistering hail of heavy metals that rattled the very earth beneath their feet. But even as the deadly projectiles rained down around them, Edward and Reaper pressed on, their steely resolve unbroken, their eyes fixed unwaveringly on their target. With a deafening roar that echoed across the battlefield, they closed in on Taj, their weapons gleaming in the flickering light of the flames. Taj's jagged blade flashed out in a fierce parry, clashing with the Reaper's scythe, before slicing through Edward's obsidian armour as if it were nothing more than paper, leaving a deep gash in his side that oozed blood like molten lava. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith a flick of his wrist, Edward flung a kilogram of enriched plutonium toward the approaching terrorist. The radioactive material reached supercritical mass, unleashing a vehement chain reaction that sent shock waves and radiation careening through the battlefield, obliterating both defenders and attackers alike. Despite the immense destruction, Taj shrugged off the explosion with ease, his armour completely undamaged. In a swift and vicious move, Taj lunged forward, his serrated blade slicing into Edward's chest with a sickening crunch as steel cleaved through bone. Blood gushed from the gaping wound as the diminutive man collapsed into the bloodstained sand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith a ferocious bellow of anger that shook the earth beneath him, Reaper charged towards Taj like a raging bull. The glimmer of his scythe in the sun was like a flash of lightning as he slashed it through the air. Taj, the Terrorist, was quick to respond, deftly dodging under Reaper's strike and launching a counter-attack with his own swift thrusts, each one aimed precisely at Reaper's heart. The resounding clash of metal against metal echoed through the battlefield as Taj relentlessly hammered away at Reaper's defence with his heavy blade, each strike denting the titanium blade. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nReaper was caught off guard as Taj continued his relentless assault, however his superior experience in combat made itself known. Blocking another slash, he lashed out with his foot, delivering a powerful kick that knocked Taj off balance. In one swift motion, Reaper swung his scythe towards Taj's neck, but the terrorist was too fast for him. With an acrobatic backflip through the air, Taj regained his balance and charged towards Reaper with a maniacal grin etched on his face. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA dark, ominous glow enveloped Taj, as if he was being imbued with some otherworldly power. Taj's blade clocked in a black aura, phased through Reaper's scythe and embedded itself deep within his chest. The smell of blood filled the air as Reaper stumbled back, tripping on the rubble. ‚ÄúThe trajectory‚Ä¶ It changed!‚Äù Reaper gasped out, blood trickling from his mouth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShan-Mei stared in grief at the battered bodies of her only friends. As tears streamed down her face, she raced towards Taj the Terrorist behind this senseless massacre, her oboe raised high in a battle stance. But Taj was ready, his cold, cruel eyes glinting with malice as he swung his blade in a wide, sweeping arc, knocking the oboe aside with ease. Undeterred, Shan-Mei pressed forward, launching a barrage of high amplitude sound waves that bounced harmlessly off Taj‚Äôs aura. With a sneer of contempt, the terrorist delivered a powerful kick to Shan-Mei's chest, cracking the translucent purple shield she had just summoned. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe resounding echoes of metal colliding against magic rang out like thunder as Taj unleashed a relentless barrage of bullets upon Shan-Mei's magical shields. The impacts were so forceful that the very air quivered with the reverberations, and each time the bullets struck, the shield‚Äôs contours shimmered and warped, threatening to collapse under the onslaught. The construct shattered like glass, millions of tiny iridescent amethyst shards disappeared into motes of light as Shan-Mie dodged and weaved, narrowly avoiding the last few bullets. With each passing moment, Shan-Mei‚Äôs limbs grew heavier, her muscles screaming for oxygen and her breaths came in short, laboured gasps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith a fierce cry of determination, Shan-Mei charged towards Taj, her amulet glowing with a brilliant purple light as she channelled all its power into her ultimate attack. An amethyst lance of energy sliced through the air with the force of a meteor, careening towards the terrorist at hypersonic speeds. Taj's dark aura expanded and darkened, twisting and warping like a malevolent vortex as he sneered. Horror adorned Shan-Mei‚Äôs features as her attack disintegrated upon contact with Taj‚Äôs aura. Taj saw his opening and took it with relish. With a deafening roar, he clapped his hands together, causing the very molecules within the air to undergo nuclear fusion. The sheer force of the reaction was cataclysmic, billions of electron volts of energy erupted from between Taj's fingers, incinerating everything in their path. Shan-Mei was flung across the battlefield like a rag doll, her body bouncing and tumbling amidst the rubble. She struggled to stay conscious, but her vision was hazy, and her ears were ringing with a high-pitched whine. As she lay there, struggling to make sense of what had just happened, Taj's cruel smile appeared before her, taunting her with the knowledge that her efforts had been in vain. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nShan-Mei's body was wracked with pain, every muscle screaming with fatigue. She struggled to remain upright, her mind a blur of confusion and desperation. But even in her weakened state, Shan-Mei refused to give up. With gritted teeth, she muttered a fervent prayer to the Choyuni gods of the innovations island, beseeching them for strength and guidance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTaj watched her with a sneer, delighting in her suffering, his dark aura pulsing with malevolent energy. As he raised his arm to deliver the final blow, Shan-Mei braced herself for the impact, her heart pounding in her chest. But then, something strange happened. A look of confusion and terror flickered across Taj's face, as if he was sensing something that was beyond the scope of normal perception. The battlefield fell silent, the incessant explosions and screams abruptly silenced. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThen, without warning, Taj's body began to convulse, his eyes rolling back into his head. Shan-Mei watched in a mixture of shock and fascination as the terrorist's body shook violently. Blood poured from his eyes as his malevolent aura started to dissipate. A cry of agony and fear resounded through the wreckage as Taj collapsed onto his knees, his armor shattering into dust and his sword falling to the ground with a deafening clang. A mixture of terror and awe adorned his face as he stared into the distance, as if beholding a vision that was too terrible to comprehend. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn a flash of light, Purple Maize appeared in all of his divine glory. Magenta wings unfurled behind his back as an admin console appeared in front of him. \u003cbr\u003e`/kill Taj_the_Terrorist`\u003cbr\u003e\nTaj‚Äôs body dissipated into motes of light as the admin entered the command. Moments later, silence returned to the battlefield as Purple Maize‚Äôs visage dissipated into countless iridescent particles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI'll replace the placeholder ending

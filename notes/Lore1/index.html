<a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/tree/hugo/content/notes/Lore1.md rel=noopener>Edit Source</a></p><ul class=tags></ul><p><strong>Shan-Mei Lore: V1</strong><br>The sprawling urban expanse unfurled out the window of the 69th floor, stretching out to the horizon, like a tapestry woven with the finest strands of concrete and steel. The cityscape emerged from the mountainous terrain, a stunning and vibrant tableau of human endeavour. The gleaming glass facades of the towering high-rise buildings illuminated the maze of streets and alleys into a shimmering mosaic of light and shadow as the afternoon sun cast its rays over the snow-capped mountains in the distance.<br><br></p><p>Amidst the ceaseless bustle and cacophony of the urban metropolis, nestled within the confines of a modest apartment, Shan-Mei sat hunched over a polished mahogany desk. The room was dimly lit by the wan glow of a solitary desk lamp, its flickering light casting ominous shadows upon the cluttered surroundings. Clutching the smooth purple amulet in her hand, as she gazed out at the cityscape beyond, her mind awhirl with creative impulses and unfettered musings. Several sheets of music paper lay scattered haphazardly amidst the cluttered desk, each one bearing the unfinished notes of a symphony yet to be born. Empty paper tea cups and crumpled tissues littered the floor, the remnants of a solitary vigil that had stretched on for hours. With a deep sigh, she pushed aside the dishevelled strands of her hair, closed her eyes, and clasped the amethyst amulet between her lithe fingers.<br><br></p><p>As the iridescent purple amulet rested in Shan-Mei&rsquo;s hand, a wave of transcendental energy surged through her, like a mighty river carving its way through the stony landscape. Enveloped in the talisman&rsquo;s celestial aura, she surrendered herself to the fathomless mysteries of the cosmos, letting the amulet guide her towards a vision of the future.<br><br></p><p>And there it was, a macabre symphony of terror and devastation that tore at the very fabric of her soul. The city she called home, once an illustrious tapestry of concrete and steel, had been ravaged by a catastrophic terrorist attack, a fury that had unleashed a torrent of nuclear fire that razed the city to the ground.<br><br></p><p>She saw the streets, once thronging with life and colour, now reduced to a smouldering wasteland, where the only signs of movement were the dancing tongues of flame that licked at the rubble and the occasional scurrying of mutated insects. The towers that once reached toward the heavens now lay scattered and broken, like shards of glass on a shattered mirror, reflecting only the pain and sorrow that now gripped the land.<br><br></p><p>And she saw the flames, great, roaring infernos that devoured everything in their path, leaving only destruction and devastation in their wake. The charred visages of her last few remaining friends burnt themselves into her mind, their faces distorted by fear and anguish, as tendrils of flame reached for Shan-Mei, eager to devour her. As the conflagration enveloped her, Shan-Mei braced for the scorching pain, but it never came.<br><br></p><p>As the vision faded away, Shan-Mei slowly opened her eyes, her consciousness returning to the reality of her small apartment. The familiar surroundings of the room, once so comforting and mundane, now felt oppressive and suffocating. She gasped for breath, her heart racing with a primal fear that refused to subside.<br><br></p><p>Collapsing to the floor, she clutched the amulet in her trembling hands, desperately trying to make sense of what she had just seen. Was it a warning, a premonition of things to come? Or was it merely a hallucination, a manifestation of her own fears and insecurities?<br><br></p><p>But as she lay there, lost in thought, a distant rumble jolted her back to the present. It was a sound she had never heard before, a deep, thunderous roar that seemed to shake the very foundations of the earth.<br><br></p><p>She got up, stumbling towards the window, her legs weak and unsteady. And then she saw it, a blinding flash of light that illuminated the sky with an eerie, orange glow. A wave of heat and pressure blasted through the apartment, shattering the glass and throwing her back against the wall.<br><br></p><p>Ascending to a standing position with great haste, Shan-Mei sprang out of shattered window, while a deluge of detritus and pulverized masonry cascaded down from the ceiling like a rainstorm. Muttering a quick prayer to the Choyuni deities with her amulet in hand, a amethyst aura enveloped her lithe frame as she accelerated towards the ground at 9.806 meters per second squared. As her sneakers landed upon the buckling pavement, the aura shattered like glass, millions of fragments disappearing into thin air, as her fall damage was negated. She landed just in time to behold the next barrage of incendiary missiles plummeting towards the metropolis like a swarm of locusts. The scorching temperature and blinding light forced her to cover her eyes as she bolted down the fragmented pavement, skilfully evading the detonations of cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine and fragments of shattered infrastructure that littered the streets.<br><br></p><p>As Shan-Mei fled, a silhouette materialized in the distance, its visage distorted and contorted by the swirling, seething clouds of ash and smoke. It was none other than Taj the Terrorist, a notorious figure whose fanaticism and malice had driven him to perpetrate unspeakable acts of atrocity and annihilation. The malevolent aura emanating from him was palpable, his countenance an ungodly amalgamation of darkness and fury, like a demon rising from the depths of hell.<br><br></p><p>Taj’s features twisted into a cruel and malevolent sneer, his eyes gleaming with a savage light as he advanced towards Shan-Mei with a cold and calculating menace. Terror gripped Shan-Mei as she stared into Taj’s sunken eyes which smouldered with a cold, unyielding fire. His movements were fluid and graceful, his body seeming to flow through the wreckage like a wraith as he closed in on his prey.<br><br></p><p>Before Shan-Mei could muster a response, a searing, blinding pain coursed through her body Her senses were overwhelmed by the jarring sensation of her body hurtling through the air, before her world was abruptly extinguished by a deafening crash.<br><br></p><p>When she came to, her vision was blurred by the crimson fluid snaking down her face like a river, mingling with the soot and dust that coated her skin. Her limbs were wracked with excruciating pain, and an immense weight crushed down on her legs, Jagged edges of steel and concrete bit into her tender flesh as bright red blood poured out of her numerous wounds. Her screams of anguish, drowned out by the cacophony of explosions and the crackling of flames, went unanswered as her vision dimmed.<br><br></p><p>Through her pain-addled haze, she caught a fleeting glimpse of the terrorist, his malevolent smirk taunting her from the distance. He vanished into the inferno as darkness claimed her once again.<br><br></p><p>As the sun retreated beyond the horizon, a somber darkness cloaked the desolated city. The mangled streetlights flickered dimly, casting their light through a sickly green radioactive haze over the rubble, illuminating Edward&rsquo;s path as he tirelessly searched for survivors amidst the wreckage. Suddenly, a faint cry for help seized his attention, compelling him to investigate. As he traced the origin of the sound, his eyes were met with a scene of devastation. A diminutive teenage girl lay crumpled on the ground, her feeble whimpers filling the silence like a mournful dirge. The sight of her injuries pierced Edward&rsquo;s heart like a serrated knife. Despite his limited medical knowledge, he knew that her wounds were near fatal. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he rushed to her side, extending his hand to her. &ldquo;Come with me. I can heal you,&rdquo; he spoke in a deep voice that reverberated through the scorched husks of the nearby buildings. &ldquo;I can take you to a safe haven, far away from this nightmare.&rdquo; Shan-Mei weakly nodded her head in agreement, and with that, Edward carefully lifted her into his arms, disappearing into the obscurity of the night.<br><br></p><p>The sands of time continued their relentless march forward, and days blurred together into an ephemeral tapestry. After, Shan-Mei recuperated from her injuries, she adjusted to her new life in Edward&rsquo;s quaint town quite well. She soon discovered that she had stumbled upon a vibrant cast of eccentric characters. There was Reaper, a man with an unwavering passion for military aircraft that bordered on the obsessive, and Edward, a man with a home constructed entirely out of obsidian, who had amassed an astonishing knowledge of chemistry. Then there was Choyu, a curiously intriguing individual with a peculiar fascination with writing Shan-Mei Lore and making strange computer games. Despite their peculiarities, the townsfolk were an incredibly hospitable and warm-hearted group of people, welcoming Shan-Mei with open arms into their community. In this newfound haven, she felt a sense of belonging that she had never experienced in the city.<br><br></p><p>Under Edward&rsquo;s skilled guidance, Shan-Mei embarked on the daunting task of reconstructing her home, using .md files and markdown. Despite the gruelling and time-consuming nature of the process, Shan-Mei found immense joy in the project. Every day was a new adventure, as she worked tirelessly to erect new rooms, meticulously crafting them with a deft hand and an artist&rsquo;s eye for detail. She adorned her abode with the finest decor and furnishings, each piece chosen with care, and arranged in a manner that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Despite the isolated and barren nature of the surrounding desert, Shan-Mei found a sense of serenity in the quietude, as though the tranquil stillness of the desert was a balm that soothed her aching soul. The desert was like a vast, sprawling canvas, punctuated by the occasional bloom of a wildflower or the darting flight of a bird. In this idyllic setting, Shan-Mei was free to create her own sanctuary, a place where she could rebuild her life with a renewed sense of purpose and hope.<br><br></p><p>However, Shan-Mei could not shake off the gnawing feeling that Taj&rsquo;s return was inevitable. She knew that he would stop at nothing to annihilate what little remained of the city, and thus she embarked on a rigorous regimen of training, working tirelessly to hone her skills and fortify her body and mind. She engaged in rigorous martial arts training, perfecting her technique and refining her combat tactics with the aid of the astute Reaper, whose military expertise was invaluable in the face of the impending threat. Shan-Mei also honed her magical prowess, delving deep into the arcane mysteries of her amulet, seeking to unlock its full potential as a weapon. And yet, despite the preparations and the fortifications, the threat of Taj&rsquo;s return loomed over them like a thunderhead on the horizon, casting a pall of uncertainty over their oasis. The townspeople worked tirelessly, fortifying their community against the impending onslaught. Towering obsidian walls and glistening quartz towers rose from the sands, seemingly impenetrable as all forms of projectile weapons protruded from the ramparts.<br><br></p><p>Despite Shan-Mei&rsquo;s meticulous preparations, Taj&rsquo;s return was an unbridled cataclysm of destruction. Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, like fiery harbingers of doom, rained down from the heavens, unleashing apocalyptic nuclear devastation that encircled the fortified oasis in a deadly embrace. As the air grew thick with the acrid stench of sulfur and ash, hordes of clones and hired mercenaries descended upon the town like a pack of ravening wolves, their savage fury unleashed in a hail of rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire that tore into the crumbling obsidian wall with ferocious intensity, sending jagged shards of glass-like rock flying in all directions. The once-peaceful town was transformed into a chaotic battlefield, the echoes of gunfire and the screams of the wounded reverberating through the air like a haunting dirge of despair.<br><br></p><p>Edward and Reaper emerged from the chaos, their faces set in grim determination as they charged headlong towards the maniacal Taj, wielding flasks of volatile chemicals and Reaper&rsquo;s ominous scythe. Taj, the terrorist, met their fierce onslaught head-on, his modified machine gun spitting out depleted uranium rounds at hypersonic speeds, unleashing a blistering hail of heavy metals that rattled the very earth beneath their feet. But even as the deadly projectiles rained down around them, Edward and Reaper pressed on, their steely resolve unbroken, their eyes fixed unwaveringly on their target. With a deafening roar that echoed across the battlefield, they closed in on Taj, their weapons gleaming in the flickering light of the flames. Taj&rsquo;s jagged blade flashed out in a fierce parry, clashing with the Reaper&rsquo;s scythe, before slicing through Edward&rsquo;s obsidian armour as if it were nothing more than paper, leaving a deep gash in his side that oozed blood like molten lava.<br><br></p><p>With a flick of his wrist, Edward flung a kilogram of enriched plutonium toward the approaching terrorist. The radioactive material reached supercritical mass, unleashing a vehement chain reaction that sent shock waves and radiation careening through the battlefield, obliterating both defenders and attackers alike. Despite the immense destruction, Taj shrugged off the explosion with ease, his armour completely undamaged. In a swift and vicious move, Taj lunged forward, his serrated blade slicing into Edward&rsquo;s chest with a sickening crunch as steel cleaved through bone. Blood gushed from the gaping wound as the diminutive man collapsed into the bloodstained sand.<br><br></p><p>With a ferocious bellow of anger that shook the earth beneath him, Reaper charged towards Taj like a raging bull. The glimmer of his scythe in the sun was like a flash of lightning as he slashed it through the air. Taj, the Terrorist, was quick to respond, deftly dodging under Reaper&rsquo;s strike and launching a counter-attack with his own swift thrusts, each one aimed precisely at Reaper&rsquo;s heart. The resounding clash of metal against metal echoed through the battlefield as Taj relentlessly hammered away at Reaper&rsquo;s defence with his heavy blade, each strike denting the titanium blade.<br><br></p><p>Reaper was caught off guard as Taj continued his relentless assault, however his superior experience in combat made itself known. Blocking another slash, he lashed out with his foot, delivering a powerful kick that knocked Taj off balance. In one swift motion, Reaper swung his scythe towards Taj&rsquo;s neck, but the terrorist was too fast for him. With an acrobatic backflip through the air, Taj regained his balance and charged towards Reaper with a maniacal grin etched on his face.<br><br></p><p>A dark, ominous glow enveloped Taj, as if he was being imbued with some otherworldly power. Taj&rsquo;s blade clocked in a black aura, phased through Reaper&rsquo;s scythe and embedded itself deep within his chest. The smell of blood filled the air as Reaper stumbled back, tripping on the rubble. “The trajectory… It changed!” Reaper gasped out, blood trickling from his mouth.<br><br></p><p>Shan-Mei stared in grief at the battered bodies of her only friends. As tears streamed down her face, she raced towards Taj the Terrorist behind this senseless massacre, her oboe raised high in a battle stance. But Taj was ready, his cold, cruel eyes glinting with malice as he swung his blade in a wide, sweeping arc, knocking the oboe aside with ease. Undeterred, Shan-Mei pressed forward, launching a barrage of high amplitude sound waves that bounced harmlessly off Taj’s aura. With a sneer of contempt, the terrorist delivered a powerful kick to Shan-Mei&rsquo;s chest, cracking the translucent purple shield she had just summoned.<br><br></p><p>The resounding echoes of metal colliding against magic rang out like thunder as Taj unleashed a relentless barrage of bullets upon Shan-Mei&rsquo;s magical shields. The impacts were so forceful that the very air quivered with the reverberations, and each time the bullets struck, the shield’s contours shimmered and warped, threatening to collapse under the onslaught. The construct shattered like glass, millions of tiny iridescent amethyst shards disappeared into motes of light as Shan-Mie dodged and weaved, narrowly avoiding the last few bullets. With each passing moment, Shan-Mei’s limbs grew heavier, her muscles screaming for oxygen and her breaths came in short, laboured gasps.<br><br></p><p>With a fierce cry of determination, Shan-Mei charged towards Taj, her amulet glowing with a brilliant purple light as she channelled all its power into her ultimate attack. An amethyst lance of energy sliced through the air with the force of a meteor, careening towards the terrorist at hypersonic speeds. Taj&rsquo;s dark aura expanded and darkened, twisting and warping like a malevolent vortex as he sneered. Horror adorned Shan-Mei’s features as her attack disintegrated upon contact with Taj’s aura. Taj saw his opening and took it with relish. With a deafening roar, he clapped his hands together, causing the very molecules within the air to undergo nuclear fusion. The sheer force of the reaction was cataclysmic, billions of electron volts of energy erupted from between Taj&rsquo;s fingers, incinerating everything in their path. Shan-Mei was flung across the battlefield like a rag doll, her body bouncing and tumbling amidst the rubble. She struggled to stay conscious, but her vision was hazy, and her ears were ringing with a high-pitched whine. As she lay there, struggling to make sense of what had just happened, Taj&rsquo;s cruel smile appeared before her, taunting her with the knowledge that her efforts had been in vain.<br><br></p><p>Shan-Mei&rsquo;s body was wracked with pain, every muscle screaming with fatigue. She struggled to remain upright, her mind a blur of confusion and desperation. But even in her weakened state, Shan-Mei refused to give up. With gritted teeth, she muttered a fervent prayer to the Choyuni gods of the innovations island, beseeching them for strength and guidance.<br><br></p><p>Taj watched her with a sneer, delighting in her suffering, his dark aura pulsing with malevolent energy. As he raised his arm to deliver the final blow, Shan-Mei braced herself for the impact, her heart pounding in her chest. But then, something strange happened. A look of confusion and terror flickered across Taj&rsquo;s face, as if he was sensing something that was beyond the scope of normal perception. The battlefield fell silent, the incessant explosions and screams abruptly silenced.<br><br></p><p>Then, without warning, Taj&rsquo;s body began to convulse, his eyes rolling back into his head. Shan-Mei watched in a mixture of shock and fascination as the terrorist&rsquo;s body shook violently. Blood poured from his eyes as his malevolent aura started to dissipate. A cry of agony and fear resounded through the wreckage as Taj collapsed onto his knees, his armour shattering into dust and his sword falling to the ground with a deafening clang. A mixture of terror and awe adorned his face as he stared into the distance, as if beholding a vision that was too terrible to comprehend.<br><br></p><p>In an instantaneous burst of luminescence, Purple Maize materialized, emanating an awe-inspiring manifestation of his celestial majesty. His form was bedecked with resplendent magenta wings, unfurled behind him in an ethereal display. Within the depths of his eyes flickered an intense flame of retribution, reflecting the profound determination of the sombre titan. In his outstretched arm, he brandished a gleaming blade, meticulously crafted from celestial energies, and adorned with meticulously entwined amethyst gemstones upon its hilt.<br><br></p><p>As Terrorist Taj beheld this divine spectacle, a profound trepidation overcame him, prompting him to retreat, shrinking and withering in the face of the holy aura exuding from the deity. The once menacing countenance of Taj was reduced to a pitiable semblance, beset by the devastating effects of the god&rsquo;s transcendental power.<br><br></p><p>With a resolute descent, Purple Maize&rsquo;s sword delivered an impactful strike, resonating with an unyielding force that reverberated throughout the vast expanse of the desert. In its wake, an extraordinary deluge of divine potency was unleashed, surging forth and engulfing Taj in its cataclysmic torrent.<br><br></p><p>Prologue: <a href=https://cringe.toomwn.xyz/notes/Lore2>Henry Bird Lore</a><br>Next Chapter: <a href=https://cringe.toomwn.xyz/notes/Lore3>Edward Lore</a></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://cringe.toomwn.xyz/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Tom Qiu using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://cringe.toomwn.xyz>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/GrimReaper2654>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>

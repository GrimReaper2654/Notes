<a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/tree/hugo/content/notes/Lore3.md rel=noopener>Edit Source</a></p><ul class=tags></ul><p><strong>Edward Lore:</strong> Note: this contains a lot of inside jokes. If something is weird or out of place, it is probably an inside joke that you don&rsquo;t know.<br>With a languid motion, Edward pried open his eyes, his chest throbbing with a dull, persistent ache. His surroundings materialized before him—an assemblage of pristine white walls, ethereal curtains, and immaculate sheets. It was a hospital room, but not the dilapidated one steeped in nostalgic memories from his childhood. This sterile abode exuded a novel, glossy veneer, emanating an air of modernity. The room reverberated with the dissonant symphony of machines, their metallic beeps, and gentle hums, seeping into his consciousness.<br><br></p><p>&ldquo;Edward! You&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice, brimming with exuberance. He turned his head, and there stood Shan-Mei, his object of affection. Her cascading ebony hair framed her slender physique, adorned with a pristine school uniform.<br><br></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Shan-Mei,&rdquo; he croaked, his voice barely above a whisper. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;<br><br></p><p>&ldquo;Do you not remember?&rdquo; she inquired, clasping his hand with fervour. &ldquo;You got beaten up by Taj, the terrorist demon. That thing nearly cut you in half!&rdquo;<br><br></p><p>Edward blinked, grappling with fragmented fragments of memory. Vaguely, he pieced together an image of a shadowy figure concealed beneath a black mask, wielding a serrated obsidian blade with a maniacal grin plastered on his face.<br><br></p><p>&ldquo;Where is he? Was he defeated?&rdquo; he implored, his voice quivering with anticipation.<br><br></p><p>Shan-Mei shook her head, a touch of sorrow tainting her expression. &ldquo;He is probably dead. Purple Maize killed him with an energy blast, although his body was never found. Taj could still be out there somewhere.&rdquo;<br><br></p><p>Edward was beset by a clammy perspiration, tracing an icy path across his furrowed brow. He directed his gaze towards the window, where the resplendent sun cast its golden radiance upon a boundless expanse of sand, a vista that typified his residence in a diminutive desert town. This forsaken outpost harboured a select, dependable cadre of survivors, united by their shared confrontation with the unfathomable horrors that plagued the Earth. Taj stood as but one amongst the few macabre entities enshrined within the surviving manuscripts of the Choyuni bible.<br><br></p><p>A groan of agonized despair shattered the fragile calm, commanding Edward&rsquo;s attention. His gaze swerved towards the adjacent hospital bed, where the enigmatic figure known as Reaper lay, ensconced in an intricate web of bandages that concealed his entire form. This military aficionado, renowned for his indomitable spirit, had likewise succumbed to the merciless assault of Taj, sacrificing himself in the futile endeavour of safeguarding Edward from the clutches of the nefarious demon.<br><br></p><p>Edward&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock and horror as a relisation dawned on him. “Nooooo!” he gasped as tears welled in his eyes, “My chem grade! I MISSED THE CHEM TITRATION!!!!” Reaper’s health mattered little to him, only chem mattered. An indescribable sense of guilt gnawed at Edward’s core, for he hadn’t been studying chem in the weeks that he had been unconscious.<br><br></p><p>Summoning the reservoirs of fortitude nestled deep within his being, Edward gingerly extended a quivering hand towards the sterile surface of the IV drip frame, resolute in his aspiration to stand up. &ldquo;I must study chem,&rdquo; he lamented, an unsteady cadence marking his proclamation, &ldquo;Chem is too important!&rdquo;<br><br></p><p>And then, almost imperceptibly, the metallic bonding withing the base of the frame weakened. Metal groaned as Edward collapsed onto the ground in a sprawling heap, his legs unable to support the weight of his body.<br><br></p><p>&ldquo;Edward,&rdquo; Shan-Mei gasped, &ldquo;Don’t push yourself, I’ll bring you your chem homework.&rdquo;
Edward&rsquo;s chest swelled with a renewed sense of purpose, intertwining with the flickering embers of hope that danced within his soul. In that fleeting moment, as their gazes met, an unbreakable bond formed between them. “I love you, Shan-Mei. You’re the best.” Edward rasped as he lay back down in the hospital bed, “The chem homework is on the second shelf in my bedroom.”<br><br></p><p>As Edward stared at Shan-Mei’s departing visage, his burning desire to complete his chemistry clouded his mind. “Hmm, 9.8% hydrogen, 65.6% oxygen, 18.3% carbon… That girl will make an excellent specimen for lab testing, I should work to build positive relations with her.” As Edward impatiently awaited the arrival of his chemistry equipment, he pondered another question that had been on his mind. “Why did I even try to save her in the first place?” Edward thought, scratching his chin, “Oh, I remember now. That idiot Taj was making a ruckus outside, stopping me from getting precise measurements. I had to beat him up for messing with my experiments.” Eyes burning with righteous fury, Edward envisioned the death of the terrorist demon by his own hands as an evil grin threatened to split his face in half.<br><br></p><p>Hours later, Edward’s sinister laughter pervaded his makeshift laboratory, where he skilfully manipulated the molecular essence of his elixirs, infusing them with insidious purpose. His beady black eyes glimmered with a diabolical luminescence as he skilfully amalgamated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and benzene rings. Engaging in an intricate and macabre choreography of alchemy, Edward pulverized azure crystals into a refined powder while applying heat to a bubbling solution atop a Bunsen flame. Executing a singular, well-practiced motion, he harmoniously blended several vials of chemicals, resulting in the formation of a white powder that Edward assiduously amassed within a diminutive flask. As he deeply inhaled the aroma of his triumph, a contented smile played upon Edward&rsquo;s countenance, as he concealed the minuscule vessel of maleficent toxins within his pocket.<br><br></p><p>Consumed by his malevolent pursuits and equipped with a formidable arsenal of lethal compounds, Edward proceeded to retrieve a copy of the town&rsquo;s newspaper, his intention being to avoid overlooking any consequential events that may have unfolded during his unconsciousness. Swiftly, his gaze was besieged by a barrage of bold crimson headlines, relentlessly assaulting his visual faculties. &ldquo;Town&rsquo;s Memory Depleted Once More,&rdquo; they proclaimed with audacity. A sigh escaped Edward&rsquo;s lips as he turned the page, desperately seeking news of greater relevance. Upon encountering the report of a ravaging sandstorm that had laid waste to Kento&rsquo;s poultry ranch, an insidious grin crept across Edward&rsquo;s countenance, a sinister satisfaction arising within him. His thoughts betrayed a contemptuous amusement: &ldquo;Heh, he had it coming, that fool.&rdquo; Yet, his twisted intrigue deepened as he perused further, discovering a disconcerting entry detailing the sighting of the mythical creature dubbed Wace, its proximity to the town eliciting a shudder of foreboding. And then, a revelation that ignited a seething fury within him: &ldquo;Shan-Mei Ascends to the position of Mayor!&rdquo; In an outburst of incensed wrath, the crumpled newspaper was callously flung onto the laboratory table, its contours mirroring Edward&rsquo;s inner turmoil. Clenching his fists with fervent rage, he bellowed with malicious intent, &ldquo;How dare Shan-Mei usurp my rightful place as mayor! That position is rightfully mine to claim! I saved that girl from that terrorist, and this is how she repays me?&rdquo;<br><br></p><p>Edward&rsquo;s mind raced, crafting a sinister plan to reclaim what he believed was rightfully his. His laboratory, once a haven for twisted experiments, would now become the birthing ground of his insidious coup. The vials and flasks that lined the shelves held the key to his conquest. From the array of deadly chemicals at his disposal, he deftly extracted a vial filled with a CLEAR colourless solution. Its composition was a closely guarded secret, known only to Edward himself. A single drop possessed the power to induce bizarre hallucinations upon the mind, making the victim agree with whatever Edward said.<br><br></p><p>As the moon ascended to its zenith, casting an ethereal luminescence that bathed the town in an otherworldly sheen. With unyielding determination, Edward embarked upon a deliberate stride, traversing the labyrinthine paths that led him closer to the epicentre of the settlement, where the formidable stronghold of obsidian, the mayor&rsquo;s abode, towered above the humble dwellings of the townsfolk.<br><br></p><p>The once-vibrant town square, normally teeming with vitality and animated chatter, now lay abandoned and ensconced in an unsettling stillness. Edward, akin to a phantom, glided over the red sands, his boots, imbued with nanomaterial technology, rendered soundless with every stealthy step. Weaving through the sinuous back alleys, he materialized at the rear entrance of the mess hall, his perceptive gaze immediately discerning the presence of the crate filled with precious eggs fresh form Kento’s chicken ranch, poised for tomorrow&rsquo;s breakfast feast.<br><br></p><p>Harnessing the complete potency of his malevolent compounds, Edward surreptitiously infused the eggs with his insidious toxins. The delicate fragrance of his meticulously concocted brew delicately wafted through the labyrinthine corridors, surreptitiously infiltrating every minuscule fissure, infusing the atmosphere with an indefinable aura of foreboding. A maleficent grin playing upon his lips, Edward gracefully traversed the expanse of the mess hall, methodically tainting each morsel of sustenance that fell within the scope of his sinister gaze with his pernicious chemicals. With a satisfied smile, Edward vanished into the night, leaving no trace of his presence behind.<br><br></p><p>In the shrouded embrace of the moonlit night, Edward ventured stealthily through the labyrinthine streets of the town. His keen senses were drawn to a presence that materialized ahead of him, an enigma within the nocturnal tapestry. Spicata with his mechanical right arm, lounged upon his front porch, his orange juice held delicately in one hand and a Glock in the other. An aura of detached melancholy enveloped him as his gaze fixated upon an unseen horizon, his rhythmic tapping upon the armrest resonating with an eerie cadence.<br><br></p><p>With calculated precision, Edward adeptly maneuverer around this unexpected obstruction, his every step a testament to his mastery of subterfuge. Yet, fate had other plans, for a treacherous rock lay in wait, conspiring to upset the equilibrium of his movements. In an instant, the cloak of darkness betrayed him, causing him to stumble, his diminutive stature sparing him from harm. However, dread crept insidiously into Edward&rsquo;s consciousness, as a chilling realization gripped him—Spicata&rsquo;s gaze had been fixed upon him. A surge of fear coursed through his veins, compelling him to cast a hesitant glance backward. To his astonishment, Spicata remained seated on his porch like an immobile statue, his attempts to sip from an empty glass of orange juice an eerie mimicry of normalcy. The unsettling truth emerged from the depths of Edward&rsquo;s recollection—Spicata had remained trapped in this peculiar state for two months.<br><br></p><p>Paying no mind to the strange behaviour of his &lsquo;friend&rsquo;, Edward rounded a corner, only to see his home ablaze. Flames danced voraciously, consuming everything in their path, turning his sanctuary into a chaotic inferno. The crackling of burning timber echoed through the night, harmonizing with the agonized screams of his lost possessions. Even the obsidian walls of his house were consumed by the conflagration, defying all known laws of reality. A surge of disbelief and despair engulfed him as he stood paralysed, a witness to the devastation that unfolded before his very eyes.<br><br></p><p>Time seemed to suspend its relentless march as Edward&rsquo;s mind raced to comprehend the calamity that befell his abode. A realization, sharp and bitter, cut through the haze of shock that enveloped him. It was his own negligence, an oversight fuelled by his clandestine activities, that had set this catastrophe in motion. The forgotten Bunsen burner, a harbinger of destruction, had been left unattended, its lingering flame devouring all that he held dear.<br><br></p><p>Silent tears welled up in Edward&rsquo;s eyes, their presence obscured by the soot that smeared his face. A cacophony of emotions tugged at his soul—guilt, sorrow, and a profound sense of loss. His cherished haven, a repository of secrets and solace, now lay reduced to a smouldering ruin.<br><br></p><p>Tears, wrought from the depths of his anguish, cascaded down Edward&rsquo;s weary countenance as he sought solace in the embrace of darkness. The remnants of his shattered sanctuary haunted his dreams, entwined with tendrils of remorse that gripped his soul like thorny vines. In the caverns of his desolation, he wept, each sob a testament to the weight of his sorrow. Sleep, when it finally claimed him, was fitful and turbulent, as nightmares morphed into a tempestuous storm within the recesses of his subconscious.<br><br></p><p>As dawn painted the horizon in hues of gold and vermilion, a somber calm descended upon the land. The first tendrils of sunlight, like fragile brushstrokes, whispered across the landscape, coaxing forth the awakening world from its slumber. The morning rays, as if imbued with a faint hint of compassion, gently brushed against Edward&rsquo;s face, coaxing him back to consciousness. His swollen eyes, remnants of a night steeped in grief, blinked slowly, adjusting to the soft glow that heralded the birth of a new day. With a heavy heart, yet fortified by a glimmer of resilience, Edward rose from his makeshift bed, only to see the rest of the town descend into chaos.<br><br></p><p>&ldquo;Down with the government! Down with Shan-Mei!&rdquo; reverberated with fervour through the narrow labyrinth of streets, a thunderous chorus voiced by the impassioned protesters. In tandem with their rallying cries, flames surged forth, licking at the very fabric of the urban landscape. Pitchforks and torches, wielded by hands seething with righteous fury, clashed against the impervious obsidian ramparts of the mayor&rsquo;s tower, a formidable fortress that stood as a symbol of authority. Shan-Mei, consumed by disbelief, gazed in stunned silence upon the cataclysmic tableau unfolding before her eyes, witnessing the visceral embodiment of discontent and anarchy.<br><br></p><p>Within the tempest of chaos, amidst the chaotic symphony of destruction, Edward, his thoughts fraught with remorse and bewilderment, found himself enveloped by the clamour of the frenzied mob. A stray pitchfork, propelled by their collective rage, narrowly missed its intended target, grazing Edward&rsquo;s locks with a fleeting touch, causing his hair to ripple in its wake. &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; echoed within the depths of Edward&rsquo;s troubled mind, a plea for comprehension amidst the chaos that erupted from his once meticulous plans. He yearned for someone, anyone, to rectify this spiralling descent into chaos. The unintended consequences of his actions weighed heavily upon him, for he had never intended for such rampant destruction to ensue.<br><br></p><p>Alas, Edward&rsquo;s entreaties were met with an eerie silence, his prayers lost amidst the tumultuous symphony of chaos. The indomitable walls of obsidian, the bastion that once stood resolute, now succumbed to the relentless assault of the bloodthirsty horde. Like a swarm of ants around a sugar cube, the protesters stormed into the tower, brandishing their weapons with zealous fervour. In the midst of the frenzy, Edward&rsquo;s gaze darted frantically, searching for any semblance of salvation in the sea of chaos.<br><br></p><p>And there, amidst the relentless cacophony of destruction, a semblance of order emerged—an island of surreal calm amidst the storm of destruction. Spicata, perched precariously upon his front porch, his hand cradling an untouched glass of orange juice, seemed impervious to the maelstrom that engulfed his surroundings. Unfazed by the crumbling ruins of his collapsed abode and half-demolished porch, Spicata appeared oblivious to the devastation that consumed the town.<br><br></p><p>A resounding cacophony shattered the fragile tranquillity that lingered in the air, snatching Edward&rsquo;s attention from his sombre reverie. The town warehouse, once a stalwart bastion of storage, succumbed to a cataclysmic implosion of magnificent proportions. The deafening collapse unleashed a torrential cascade of shattered fragments, a deluge of fragmented RAM sticks and SSDs that hurtled through the atmosphere in a chaotic symphony of disarray. As the debris scattered in all directions, a disquieting anomaly began to manifest itself.</p><p>Almost instantaneously, the fabric of reality itself seemed to falter, glitches rippling through the very essence of existence. The airborne pitchforks, poised mid-flight, contorted and flickered with erratic distortions, their forms subjected to the whims of corrupted data. Error windows, like spectral apparitions, materialized before the bewildered onlookers, bearing dire tidings in their stark digital typography. &ldquo;Physics.exe has stopped responding, Chemistry.exe has stopped responding.&rdquo; they lamented, a testament to the unravelling laws that governed the realm of the physical. Errors, like digital graffiti, etched themselves upon every surface, inscribing the turmoil that engulfed the world. &ldquo;Building.exe has stopped responding. Gravity.exe has stopped responding. Combustion_reaction.exe has stopped responding.&rdquo; The very foundations upon which the universe operated began to crumble, plagued by a systemic failure that brought the functioning of existence to a standstill.<br><br></p><p>In an agonizingly fleeting span of time, the town became a manifestation of halted processes, an intricate network of non-responsive modules. Each passing moment further underscored the crippling dearth of memory, as the town, akin to a beleaguered computer system, succumbed once again to its inexorable limitation. The boundaries of possibility strained against the constraints of finite resources, a relentless reminder of the fragile nature of existence in the face of overwhelming complexity. And then the town ran out of memory (once again).<br><br></p><p>Immersed within the boundless expanse of a desolate and abyssal void, Edward found himself adrift amidst an emptiness that mirrored the depths of his desolation. Shadows danced restlessly, devoid of form or substance, while an ethereal script of crimson hues materialized before him, like spectral wisps whispering dire tidings. In an ominous display, the lines of text glowed ominously, projecting their proclamation into the recesses of his consciousness: &ldquo;Fatal Error: OutOfMemoryError. Restoring latest backup.&rdquo;<br><br></p><p>Suddenly, gravity took hold again as the town materialised around Edward. His descent from the ephemeral abyss was swift and abrupt, bringing him crashing back to the realm of tangible reality. Face meeting the unyielding embrace of unforgiving concrete, he felt the harsh impact reverberate through his being as he groaned in pain.<br><br></p><p>Eagerly seeking confirmation that his mistakes had been corrected, Edward surged forward, slamming open his front door. Stepping out into the open expanse, his heart fluttered with a profound sense of solace as the tranquillity of the desert town washed over him. Gone were the signs of the previous chaos that had ensnared his psyche, replaced by a serene tableau that embraced him with gentle arms.<br><br></p><p>Amidst the stillness, as if whispered by a mystical force, a wondrous revelation seized Edward&rsquo;s attention. Nestled within the recesses of his vision, an unassuming line of text emerged, discreet yet laden with significance: &ldquo;Status: Mayor.&rdquo; The revelation, like an unexpected boon from an unseen hand, unveiled itself before his discerning gaze, casting newfound purpose upon his weary shoulders.<br><br></p><p>“Lets goooo! I’m mayor again!” Edward&rsquo;s joyous declaration pierced the stillness, echoing through the morning air. However, his elation was abruptly shattered by a single, ominous sentence that emanated from the neighbouring house. &ldquo;I saw everything.&rdquo;<br><br></p><p>Startled, Edward turned his gaze toward Spicata, whose tranquil façade remained unyielding as he sat on the porch, sipping his orange juice. Yet, an unsettling aura enveloped him, an air of sinister knowledge that belied his motionless figure. A chill coursed through Edward&rsquo;s veins, as he noticed the handgun in Spicata’s mechanical right hand.<br><br></p><p>Prev Chapter: <a href=https://cringe.toomwn.xyz/notes/Lore1>Shan-Mei Lore</a><br>Next Chapter: <a href=https://cringe.toomwn.xyz/notes/Lore4>TOOMwn Lore</a></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://cringe.toomwn.xyz/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Tom Qiu using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://cringe.toomwn.xyz>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/GrimReaper2654>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
